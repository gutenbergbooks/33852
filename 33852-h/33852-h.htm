  <p>A desire to extend the knowledge of, and by so doing to extend the
  love for, those sunny creatures called Butterflies, has prompted the
  author to undertake this little work, which, though making no pretence to
  a technically scientific character, will, it is hoped, be found
  sufficiently complete and accurate to supply all information needful to
  the young entomologist as to the names, appearance, habits, localities,
  &amp;c. of <i>all our British Butterflies</i>, together with a general
  history of butterfly life&mdash;the mode of capture, preservation, and
  arrangement in cabinets&mdash;the apparatus required, &amp;c. At the same
  time it is so inexpensive as to be accessible to every schoolboy.</p>

  <p>The subject is one which has formed the delight and study of the
  author from early boyhood, and butterfly-hunting still preserves its
  fascinations, redoubling the pleasure of the country ramble in summer.
  <!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span></p>

  <p>Should this volume be the means of inciting some to seek this source
  of healthful enjoyment, and to join in the peaceful study which may be so
  easily pursued by all dwellers in the country, it will have succeeded in
  its purpose.</p>

  <p>The whole of the illustrative portraits of the <i>butterflies</i> have
  been drawn from nature by the author, and with one exception from
  specimens in his own collection. At least one figure of each species (of
  the natural size) is given; but in very many instances, where the sexes
  differ considerably from each other, both are figured, and the under
  sides are also frequently added.</p>

  <p>The greater number of the <i>caterpillars</i> and <i>chrysalides</i>,
  however, being rarely met with, the figures on the first plate are nearly
  all borrowed from the splendid and accurate works of Continental
  authors&mdash;chiefly from Hübner and Duponchel.</p>

  <p>With great pleasure, the author here acknowledges his obligations, for
  many biographical facts relating to butterflies, to those highly useful
  periodicals, the <i>Zoologist</i> and the <i>Entomologist's Weekly
  Intelligencer</i>, the former devoted to general natural history, the
  latter especially to entomology, and whose pages register a <!-- Page vii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii"></a>{vii}</span>mass of
  interesting and original communications from correspondents who, living
  in wide-spread localities, and possessing varied opportunities of
  observation, have gradually brought together, under able editorship, a
  store of facts that could never have come within the <i>personal</i>
  experience of any one man, however industrious and observant.</p>

  <p>The capture during the past year of a new and interesting butterfly
  for the first time in this country, is recorded in this volume, in which
  the insect is also figured and described.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a missive arrives from some benevolent friend, announcing
  the capture of a "splendid butterfly," which, imprisoned under a tumbler,
  awaits one's acceptance as an addition to the cabinet. However, on going
  to claim the proffered prize, the expected "<i>butterfly</i>" turns out
  to be some bright-coloured <i>moth</i> (a Tiger moth being the favourite
  victim of the misnomer), and one's entomological propriety suffers a
  shock; not so much feeling the loss of the specimen, as concern for the
  benighted state of an otherwise intelligent friend's mind with regard to
  insect nomenclature. <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span></p>

  <p>It is clearly therefore <i>not</i> so superfluous as it might at first
  otherwise seem, to commence the subject by defining even such a familiar
  object as a <i>butterfly</i>, and more especially distinguishing it with
  certainty from a <i>moth</i>, the only other creature with which it can
  well be confounded.</p>

  <p>The usual notion of a butterfly is of a gay fluttering thing, whose
  broad painted wings are covered with a mealy stuff that comes off with
  handling. This is all very well for a general idea, but the characters
  that form it are common to some other insects besides butterflies. Moths
  and hawk-moths have mealy wings, and are often gaily coloured too;
  whilst, on the other hand, some butterflies are as dusky and plain as
  possible. Thus the crimson-winged Tiger, and Cinnabar <i>moths</i> get
  the name of <i>butterflies</i>, and the Meadow brown <i>butterfly</i> is
  as sure to be called a <i>moth</i>. So, as neither colouring nor mealy
  wings furnish us with the required definition, we must find some concise
  combination of characters that <i>will</i> answer the purpose.
  <i>Butterflies, then, are insects with mealy wings, and whose horns
  (called "antennæ") have a clubbed or thickened tip, giving them more or
  less resemblance to a drum-stick.</i> So the difference in the shape of
  the <i>antennæ</i> is the <i>chief</i> outward mark of distinction
  between butterflies and moths, the latter having <i>antennæ</i> of
  various shapes, threadlike or featherlike, but <i>never clubbed at the
  tip</i>.</p>

  <p>Having thus settled how a butterfly is to be recognized at sight, let
  us see what butterfly <i>life</i> is: how the creature lives, and has
  lived, in the stages preceding its present airy form.</p>

  <p><a name="plateI"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/i_012.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_012.png"
      alt="I." title="I." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span></p>

  <p>In like manner with other insects, all butterflies commence their
  existence enclosed in minute <i>eggs</i>; and these eggs, as if shadowing
  forth the beauty yet undeveloped whose germ they contain, are themselves
  such curiously beautiful objects, that they must not be passed over
  without admiring notice. It seems, indeed, as if nature determined that
  the ornamental character of the butterfly should commence with its
  earliest stage; form, and not colour, being employed in its decoration,
  sculpture being here made the forerunner of painting.</p>

  <p>Some of these forms are roughly shown on <a href="#plateII">Plate
  II</a>. (figs. 1-7), but highly magnified; for as these eggs are really
  very tiny structures, such as would fall easily through a pin-hole, the
  aid of a microscope is of course necessary to render visible the delicate
  sculpture that adorns their surface. The egg (fig. 1, <a
  href="#plateII">Plate II</a>.) of the common Garden white butterfly
  (<i>Pieris Brassicæ</i>) is among the most graceful and interesting of
  these forms, and also the most easily obtained. It reminds us of some
  antique vessel, ribbed and fluted with consummate elegance and
  regularity.</p>

  <p>Others&mdash;such as those of the Large Heath butterfly (fig. 3), and
  the Queen of Spain Fritillary (fig. 2), simulate curious wicker-work
  baskets. The Peacock butterfly has an egg like a polygonal jar (fig. 4),
  while that of its near ally, the large Tortoise-shell (fig. 5), is simply
  pear-shaped, with the surface unsculptured and smooth <!-- Page 4
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>(fig. 5). The eggs
  of the Meadow Brown (fig. 6), and the Wood Argus (fig. 7), are
  globular&mdash;the former with lines on its surface like the meridian
  lines on a geographical globe, and a pretty scalloping at the top that
  gives a flower-like appearance to that portion; the latter has the whole
  surface honey-combed with a network of hexagonal cells. Such are a few of
  the devices that ornament the earliest cradle of the butterfly; but
  probably those of every species would well repay their examination to any
  one who possesses a microscope.</p>

  <p>Prompted by a most remarkable instinct, and one that could not have
  originated in any experience of personal advantage, the female butterfly,
  when seeking a depository for her eggs, selects with unerring certainty
  the very plant which, of all others, is best fitted for the support of
  her offspring, who, when hatched, find themselves surrounded with an
  abundant store of their proper food.</p>

  <p>Many a young botanist would be puzzled at first sight to tell a
  sloe-bush from a buckthorn-bush. Not so, however, with our Brimstone
  butterfly: passing by all the juicy hedge-plants, which look quite as
  suitable, one would think, she, with botanical acumen, fixes upon the
  buckthorn; either the common one, or, if that is not at hand, upon
  another species of rhamnus&mdash;the berry-bearing alder&mdash;which,
  though a very different looking plant, is of the same genus, and shares
  the same properties. She evidently works out the natural system of
  botany, and might have been a pupil of Jussieu, had she not been tutored
  by a far higher <span class="sc">Authority</span>.</p>

  <p><a name="plateII"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/i_016.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_016.png"
      alt="II." title="II." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span></p>

  <p>This display of instinct would seem far less wonderful did the mother
  butterfly herself feed on the plant she commits her eggs to. In that
  case, her choice might have appeared as the result of personal experience
  of some peculiar benefit or pleasure derived from the plant, and then
  this sentiment might have become hereditary; just as, for example, the
  acquired taste for game is hereditary with sporting dogs. Whereas the
  fact is, that a butterfly only occasionally, and as a matter of accident
  rather than rule, derives her own nectareous food from the flowers of the
  plant, whose leaves nourish her caterpillar progeny. So that this, as
  well as numberless other phenomena of instinct, remains a mystery to be
  admired, but not explained by any ordinary rule of cause and effect.</p>

  <p>Having thus efficiently provided, as far as board and lodging are
  concerned, for the welfare of the future brood, the mother seems to
  consider them settled for life, takes no further care of them, nor even
  awaits the opening of the sculptured caskets that contain their tiny
  life-germs; but, trusting them to the sun's warmth for their hatching,
  and then to their own hungry little instincts to teach them good use of
  the food placed within their reach, she sees them no more.</p>

  <p>But though abandoning her offspring to fate in this manner, it must
  not be imagined that the butterfly mother takes her pattern of maternity
  from certain <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>human mothers, and in a round of "butterfly's
  balls," and such like dissipations, forgets the sacred claims of the
  nursery. No, she has far other and better excuses for absenting herself
  from her family; one of which is, that she usually dies before the latter
  are hatched; and if that is not enough, that the young can get on quite
  as well without her; for probably she could not teach them much about
  caterpillar economics, unless, indeed, she remembered her own infantile
  habits of lang syne, so totally different from those of her perfected
  butterfly life.</p>

  <p>The space of time passed in the egg state varies much according to the
  temperature&mdash;from a few days when laid in genial summer weather, to
  several months in the case of those laid in the autumn, and which remain
  quiescent during the winter, to hatch out in the spring.</p>

  <p>The eggs of butterflies, in common with those of insects in general,
  are capable of resisting not only vicissitudes, but extremes of
  temperature that would be surely destructive of life in most other forms.
  The severest cold of an English winter will not kill the tender butterfly
  eggs, whose small internal spark of vitality is enough to keep them from
  freezing under a much greater degree of cold than they are ever subjected
  to in a state of nature. For example, they have been placed in an
  artificial freezing mixture, which brought down the thermometer to 22°
  below zero&mdash;a deadly chill&mdash;and yet they survived with apparent
  <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>{7}</span>impunity, and afterwards lived to hatch duly.
  Then as to their heat-resisting powers, some tropical insects habitually
  lay their eggs in sandy, sun-scorched places, where the hand cannot
  endure to remain a few moments; the heat rising daily to somewhere about
  190° of the thermometer&mdash;and we know what a roasting one gets at 90°
  or so. Yet they thrive through all this.</p>

  <p>For a short time previous to hatching, the form and colour of the
  caterpillar is faintly discoverable through the semi-transparent
  egg-shell. The juvenile <span class="sc">Caterpillar</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Larva</span>, gnaws his way through the shell into the world,
  and makes his appearance in the shape of a slender worm, exceedingly
  minute of course, and bearing few of the distinctive marks of his
  species, either as to shape or colouring. On finding himself at liberty,
  in the midst of plentiful good cheer, he at once falls vigorously to work
  at the great business of his life&mdash;<i>eating</i>; often making his
  first meal&mdash;oddly enough&mdash;off the egg-shell, lately his cradle.
  This singular relish, or digestive pill, swallowed, he addresses himself
  to the food that is to form the staple fare during the whole of his
  caterpillar existence&mdash;viz. the leaves of his food-plant, which at
  the same time is his home-plant too.</p>

  <p>At this stage his growth is marvellously rapid, and few creatures can
  equal him in the capacity for doubling his weight&mdash;not even the
  starved lodging-house "slavey," when she gets to her new place, with
  <i>carte blanche</i> allowance and the key of the pantry; for, in the
  course <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>of twenty-four hours, he will have consumed
  more than twice his own weight of food: and with such persevering avidity
  does he ply his pleasant task, that, as it is stated, a caterpillar in
  the course of one month has increased nearly ten thousand times his
  original weight on leaving the egg; and, to furnish this increase of
  substance, has consumed the prodigious quantity of forty thousand times
  his weight of food&mdash;truly, a ruinous rate of living, only that green
  leaves are so cheap.</p>

  <p>But the life of a caterpillar, after all, is not merely the smooth
  continual feast he would doubtless prefer it to be; it is interrupted,
  several times in its course, by the necessity nature has imposed upon him
  of now and then changing his coat&mdash;to him a very troublesome, if not
  a painful affair.</p>

  <p>For some time previous to this phenomenon, even eating is nearly or
  quite suspended,&mdash;the caterpillar becomes sluggish and shy, creeping
  away into some more secluded spot, and there remaining till his time of
  trouble is over. Various twitchings and contortions of the body now
  testify to the <i>mal-aise</i> of the creature in his old coat, which,
  though formed of a material capable of a moderate amount of stretching,
  soon becomes outgrown, and most uncomfortably tight-fitting, with such a
  quick-growing person inside it: so off it must come, but it being
  unprovided with buttons, there's the rub. However, with a great deal of
  fidgeting and shoulder-shrugging, he manages to tear his coat down the
  back, and lastly, by patient efforts, shuffles off the old rag; <!-- Page
  9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>when, lo!
  underneath is a lustrous new garment, somewhat similar, but not exactly a
  copy of the last, for our beau has his peculiar dress for each epoch of
  his life,&mdash;the most splendid being often reserved for the last.</p>

  <p>This change of dress ("<i>moulting</i>," it is sometimes called) is
  repeated thrice at least in the creature's life, but more generally five
  or six times. Not only does the outer husk come off at these times, but,
  wonderful to relate! the lining membrane of all the digestive passages,
  and of the larger breathing tubes, is cast off and renewed also.</p>

  <p>After each moult, the caterpillar makes up for his loss of time by
  eating more voraciously even than before, in many instances breaking his
  fast by making a meal of his "old clo'"&mdash;an odd taste, first
  evinced, as we have seen, in earliest infancy, when he swallowed his
  cradle.</p>

  <p>On <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. are shown the chief varieties of
  form taken by the caterpillars of our British butterflies, and a glance
  at these will give, better than verbal descriptions, a general idea of
  their characteristics.</p>

  <p>Their most usual shape is elongated and almost cylindrical, or
  slightly tapering at one or both ends. Of these, some are smooth, or only
  studded with short down or hairs; such are the caterpillars of the
  Swallow-tail butterfly (fig. 1), of the Brimstone (fig. 2), Clouded
  Yellows, and Garden, and other white butterflies. Others, of the same
  <i>general</i> form, are beset with long branched spines, making perfect
  <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>; such <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>are those of the Peacock, Red Admiral,
  Painted Lady, and the Silvery Fritillaries.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars of another large section have the body considerably
  thicker in the middle (rolling-pin shaped), and the tail part two-forked,
  or <i>bifurcate</i>. This form belongs to the numerous family that
  includes the Meadow-brown (fig. 3), the Ringlets, and many others.</p>

  <p>The <i>bizarre</i> personage, at fig. 4, turns to the graceful White
  Admiral butterfly.</p>

  <p>The Purple Emperor begins his royal career in the curious form shown
  at fig. 5&mdash;a shape unique among British butterflies, as beseems that
  of their sovereign; and he carries a coronet on his brow already.</p>

  <p>All those beautiful little butterflies called the Hair-streaks (fig.
  9), the Blues (fig. 10), and the Coppers, have very short and fat
  caterpillars, that remind one forcibly of wood-lice&mdash;a shape shared
  also by that small butterfly with a big name, the Duke of Burgundy
  Fritillary (fig. 8), an insect very distinct from the Fritillaries above
  mentioned with thorny caterpillars.</p>

  <p>The <i>legs of a caterpillar are usually sixteen in number</i>, and
  composed of two distinct kinds, viz. of <i>six true legs</i>, answering
  to those of the perfect insect, and placed on the foremost segments of
  the body; and of <i>ten</i> others, called "<i>prolegs</i>;" temporary
  legs, used principally for strengthening the creature's hold upon leaf or
  branch.</p>

  <p>Like the rest of its body, the caterpillar's head widely <!-- Page 11
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>differs in
  structure from that of the perfect insect, being furnished with a pair of
  jaws, horny and strong, befitting the heavy work they have to get
  through, and shaped like pincers, opening and shutting from side to side,
  instead of working up and down after the manner of the jaws in vertebrate
  animals. This arrangement offers great convenience to the creature,
  feeding, as it is wont to do, on the thin edge of a leaf. It is a curious
  sight to watch a caterpillar thus engaged. Adhering by his close-clinging
  prolegs, and guiding the edge of the leaf between his forelegs, he
  stretches out his head as far as he can reach, and commences a series of
  rapid bites, at each nibble bringing the head nearer the legs, till they
  almost meet; then stretching out again the same regular set of mouthfuls
  is abstracted, and so on, repeating the process till a large
  semi-circular indentation is formed, reaching perhaps to the midrib of
  the leaf; then shifting his position to a new vantage ground, the
  marauder recommences operations, another sweep is taken out, then
  another, and soon the leaf is left a mere skeleton.</p>

  <p>But a change, far more important than mere skin-shifting, follows
  close upon the animal's caterpillar-maturity, complete as soon as it
  ceases to grow.</p>

  <p>The form and habits of a worm are to be exchanged for the glories and
  pleasures of winged life; but this can only be done at the price of
  passing through an intermediate state; one neither of eating, nor of
  flying, but motionless, helpless and death-like. <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span></p>

  <p>This is called the <span class="sc">Chrysalis</span> <i>or</i> <span
  class="sc">Pupa</span> <i>state</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pupa</i> is a Latin word, signifying a creature swathed, or tied
  up; and is applied to this stage of all insects, because all, or some, of
  their parts are then bound up, as if swathed.</p>

  <p>The term <i>Chrysalis</i> is applicable to butterflies only, and,
  strictly, only to a few of these&mdash;<i>Chrysalis</i><a name="NtA1"
  href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> being derived from the Greek <span
  title="chrusos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&rho;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>chrysos</i>),
  <i>gold</i>&mdash;in allusion to the splendid gilding of the surface in
  certain species, such as the <i>Vanessas</i>, Fritillaries, and some
  others.</p>

  <p>In the older works on entomology we frequently meet with the term
  <i>Aurelia</i> applied to this state, and having the same meaning as
  chrysalis, but derived from the Latin word <i>Aurum</i>, gold.</p>

  <p>Here the reader is again referred to <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.
  for a series of the principal forms assumed by the chrysalides of our
  native butterflies, and as these for the most part represent the next
  stage of the caterpillars previously figured, an opportunity is afforded
  of tracing the insect's form through its three great changes; the whole
  of the butterflies in their perfect state being given in their proper
  places in the body of the work.</p>

<p><!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span></p>

  <p>The complicated and curious processes by which various caterpillars
  assume the chrysalis form, and suspend themselves securely in their
  proper attitudes, have been most accurately and laboriously chronicled by
  the French naturalist, Réaumur; but his memoirs on the subject, which
  have been frequently quoted into the larger entomological works, are too
  long for insertion here in full, and any considerable abbreviation would
  fail to convey a clear idea of the process, on account of the intricacy
  of the operations described. So I can only here allude to the difficult
  problems that the creature has to solve, referring the reader to the
  above-mentioned works for a detailed description of the manner of doing
  so; or, better still, I would recommend the country resident to witness
  all this with his own eyes. By keeping a number of the caterpillars of
  our common butterflies, feeding them up, and attentively watching them
  when full-grown, he will now and then detect one in the transformation
  act, and have an opportunity of wondering at the curious man&oelig;uvres
  of the animal, as it triumphs over seeming impossibilities.</p>

  <p>By reference to the figures of chrysalides on <a href="#plateI">Plate
  I</a>. it will be seen that there are two distinct modes of suspension
  employed among them; one, by the tail only, the head hanging down freely
  in the air:&mdash;in the other, the tail is attached to the supporting
  object; but the head, instead of swinging loosely, is kept in an upright
  position by being looped round the waist with a silken girdle.</p>

  <p>To appreciate the difficulty of gaining either of the above positions,
  we must bear in mind that, before doing so, the caterpillar has to throw
  off its own skin, carrying with it the whole of its legs, and the jaws
  <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>too&mdash;leaving itself a mere limbless,
  and apparently helpless mass&mdash;its only prehensile organs being a few
  minute, almost imperceptible hooks on the end of the tail; and the
  required position of attachment and security is accomplished by a series
  of movements so dexterous and sleight-of-hand like, as to cause infinite
  astonishment to the looker-on, and, as Réaumur justly observes, "It is
  impossible not to wonder, that an insect, which executes them but once in
  its life, should execute them so well. We must necessarily conclude that
  it has been instructed by a <span class="sc">Great Master</span>; for He
  who has rendered it necessary for the insect to undergo this change, has
  likewise given it all the requisite means for accomplishing it in
  safety."</p>

  <p>If we examine a chrysalis we are able to make out, through the thin
  envelope, all the external organs of the body stowed away in the most
  orderly and compact manner. The antennæ are very conspicuous, folded down
  alongside of the legs; and precisely in the centre will be seen the
  tongue, unrolled and forming a straight line between the legs. The
  unexpanded wings are visible on each side&mdash;very small, but with all
  their veinings distinctly seen; and the breathing holes, called
  spiracles, are placed in a row on each side of the body.</p>

  <p>The duration of the chrysalis stage, like that of the egg, is
  extremely variable, and dependent on difference of temperature. As an
  instance of this, one of our common butterflies has been known to pass
  only seven <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>or eight days in the chrysalis state; this
  would be in the heat of summer. Then, in the spring, the change occupies
  a fortnight; but when the caterpillar enters the chrysalis state in the
  autumn, the butterfly does not make its appearance till the following
  spring. Furthermore, it has been proved by experiment, that if the
  condition of perpetual winter be kept up by keeping the chrysalis in an
  icehouse, its development may be retarded for two or three years beyond
  its proper time; while, on the other hand, if in the middle of winter the
  chrysalis be removed to a hothouse, the enclosed butterfly, mistaking the
  vivifying warmth for returning summer, makes its <i>début</i> in ten days
  or a fortnight.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We now arrive at the last stage, the consummation of all this strange
  series of transformations; for veritable transformations they are to all
  intents and purposes; though some learned naturalists have
  discovered&mdash;or imagined so&mdash;that the butterfly, in all its
  parts, really lies hid under the caterpillar's skin, and can be
  distinguished under microscopical dissection; and that, therefore, the
  so-called transformations are merely the throwing off of the various
  envelopes or husks, as they become in turn superfluous, as a mountebank
  strips off garment after garment, till lastly the sparkling harlequin is
  discovered to view; or, in more exact language, they consider these
  changes in the light rather of successive developments and emancipations
  of the various organs than as their actual transformations. Still, it
  seems to me, the difference is chiefly one of terms. The real wondrous
  fact remains undiminished and <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>unexplained; that a creeping wormlike
  creature, in process of time, is changed into a glorious winged being,
  differing from the former in form, habits, food, and every essential
  particular, as widely as any two creatures can well differ, as widely as
  a serpent from a bird, for instance.</p>

  <p>As the imprisoned butterfly approaches maturity, a change is
  observable in the exterior of the chrysalis, the skin becomes dry and
  brittle, usually darkens in colour, and if the enclosed butterfly be a
  strongly marked one, the pattern of its wings shows through, often quite
  distinctly.</p>

  <p>When the fulness of time arrives, the creature breaks through its thin
  casings, which divide in several places, and the freed insect crawls up
  into some convenient spot to dry itself, and allow the wings to
  expand.</p>

  <p>All the organs are at first moist and tender, but on exposure to the
  air soon acquire strength and firmness.</p>

  <p>At the moment of emergence, the wings are very miniature affairs,
  sometimes hardly one-twentieth of their full size when expanded; but so
  rapid is their increase in volume, that they may actually be seen to
  grow, as the fluids from the body are pumped into the nervures that
  support the wing-membrane, and keep it extended.</p>

  <p>In the more strongly marked, or richly coloured species, it is a
  wonderfully beautiful sight to watch this expansion of the wings, and to
  see the various features <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>of their painted devices growing under the
  eye and developing gradually into their true proportions.</p>

  <p>Generally within an hour the development is complete, and the wings,
  having gained their full expanse and consistency by drying in the sun,
  are ready for flight, and the glad creature wings his way to the fields
  of air, and enters on that life of sunshine and hilarity which is
  associated with the very name of "<i>Butterfly</i>."</p>

  <p>But not every chrysalis arrives at this happy consummation of its
  existence. Supposing that you have reared and watched a caterpillar to
  apparently healthy maturity, that it has duly become a chrysalis, and you
  are awaiting its appearance in butterfly splendour&mdash;peeping into
  your box some morning to see if the bright expected one is "out," be not
  surprised if in its stead you find the box tenanted by a swarm of little
  black flies&mdash;an impish-looking crew. Whence came all these? Why they
  and the empty chrysalis shell are all that remains of your cherished
  prize; so look no more for the fair sunny butterfly, devoured ere born by
  that ill-favoured troop of darklings who have just now issued from the
  lifeless shell.</p>

  <p>The truth is, that long since, perhaps in early larva-hood, the
  creature's fate was sealed; a deadly enemy to his race is ever on the
  alert, winging about in the shape of a small black fly, in search of an
  exposed and defenceless caterpillar. Having selected her victim, she
  pierces his body with a sharp cutting instrument she is armed with, and
  in the wound deposits an egg; the <!-- Page 19 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>caterpillar winces a
  little at this treatment, but seems to attach little importance to it.
  Meanwhile his enemy repeats her thrusts till some thirty or forty eggs,
  germs of the destroyers, are safely lodged in his body, and his doom is
  certain beyond hope. The eggs quickly hatch into grubs, who begin to gnaw
  away at the unhappy creature's flesh, thus reducing him gradually, but by
  a profound instinct keeping clear of all the vital organs, as if knowing
  full well that the creature must keep on feeding and digesting too, or
  their own supply would speedily fail; as usurers, while draining a
  client, keep up his credit with the world as long as they can.</p>

  <p>Weaker grows the caterpillar as the gnawing worms within grow stronger
  and nearer maturity. Sometimes he dies a caterpillar, sometimes he has
  strength left to take the chrysalis shape, but out of this he
  <i>never</i> comes a butterfly&mdash;the consuming grubs now finish
  vitals and all, turn to pupæ in his empty skin, and come out soon, black
  flies like their parent.</p>

  <p>But, supposing that it has escaped this great danger, we now see the
  creature in its completest form, as the</p>

<p class="cenhead">IMAGO, OR PERFECT BUTTERFLY.</p>

  <p>The first term, <i>Imago</i>, is a Latin one, merely signifying an
  image, or distinct unveiled form; as distinguished from the previous
  <i>larva</i>, or masked state, and the <i>pupa</i>, or swathed and
  enveloped state. The word <i>imago</i> then, in works on entomology,
  always means the <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>perfect and last stage of insect life, and
  is applied to all insects with wings&mdash;for it must be borne in mind
  that no insect is ever winged till it reaches the last stage of its
  existence.</p>

  <p>If the progressive development of these lovely beings is so
  marvellous, no less so is their structure when perfected, and of this
  some general description must now be attempted.</p>

  <p>In contemplating a butterfly, one feels that the mind is first engaged
  by that ample spread, and exquisite painting of the wings that form the
  creature's glory; let therefore these remarkable organs have our first
  attention.</p>

  <p>Wherein do these wings chiefly differ from all other insect wings?
  Certainly in being covered thickly with a variously coloured powdery
  material, easily removed by handling. This apparent dust is composed, in
  reality, of a vast number of regularly and beautifully formed
  <i>scales</i>&mdash;feathers they are sometimes called, but they are more
  comparable to fish scales than to any other kind of natural covering. The
  general term <i>Lepidoptera</i>, applied to <i>all</i> butterflies and
  moths, is derived from these <i>scaly-wings</i>; <i>Lepis</i><a
  name="NtA2" href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> being the Greek for a
  <i>scale</i>, and <i>ptera</i> meaning <i>wings</i> in the same
  language.</p>

  <p>The use of a tolerably powerful pocket lens will afford <i>some</i>
  insight into the exquisite mode of painting</p>

<p><!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span></p>

  <p>employed in these matchless pieces of decoration; but the possessor of
  a regular microscope may, by applying it to some of our commonest
  butterflies, open for himself a world of beauty, and feast his eyes on a
  combination of refined sculpture with splendour of colouring; now melting
  in softest harmony, then relieved by boldest contrast&mdash;a spectacle,
  the first sight of which seldom fails to call forth expressions of
  wonderment and warm delight; and, truly, little to be envied is the mind
  untouched by such utter beauty as here displayed.</p>

  <p>As an example of the method by which this admirable effect is
  produced, let us take a small portion of the wing of the Peacock, a very
  beautiful, though an abundant species, and one admirably adapted for
  microscopic examination, and to illustrate the subject, from the great
  variety of rich tints brought together in a small space, the part
  selected being the eye-like spot at the outer corner of each upper wing.
  Even to the naked eye this appears as a very splendidly coloured object,
  yet but little of its exquisite mechanism can be discovered by the
  unassisted organ. Something more is brought out by a moderately strong
  lens: we then see the colours disposed in rows, reminding us of the
  surface of Brussels carpet, or of certain kinds of tapestry work.</p>

  <p>Now let us place the wing on the stage of a good microscope, with the
  root of the wing pointing towards the light (that is the best position
  for it); we shall then first perceive that the whole surface is covered,
  or, so to <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>speak, tiled over with distinct, sharply cut
  <i>scales</i>, arranged as in fig. 16, <a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>.,
  with the outer or free edges of one row overlapping the roots of the
  next. These roots being all planted towards the base of the wing, if we
  place that end next the light (as above directed), the free edges of the
  scales throw a strong shadow on the next row, which brings out the
  imbricated effect most strikingly.</p>

  <p>Beginning our observations at the outer edge of the wing, we first
  notice a delicate fringe of scales or plumes, more elongated and pointed
  than the surface scales, and of a quiet brown colour. This tint is
  continued inwards for a short space, gradually lightening, when (as we
  shift the field of view towards the centre of the wing) the colour of the
  scales suddenly changes to an intense black; then a little further, and
  the black ground is all spangled with glittering sapphires, then strewed
  deep with amethyst round a heap of whitest pearls. Golden
  topaz&mdash;(jewels only will furnish apt terms of comparison for these
  insect gems)&mdash;golden topaz ends the bright many-coloured crescent,
  and in the centre is enclosed a spot of profoundest black, gradating into
  a rich unnameable red, whose velvet depth and softness contrast
  deliciously with the adjacent flashing lustre; then comes another field
  of velvet black, then more gold, and so on till the gorgeous picture is
  complete.</p>

  <p>Subject a piece of finest human painting to the scrutiny of a strong
  magnifying glass, and where is the beauty thereof? Far from being
  magnified, it will have wholly vanished: its cleverest touches turned to
  coarse, repulsive daubs and stains.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">

      alt="IV." title="IV." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span></p>

  <p>Now, bring the microscope's most searching powers to bear upon the
  painting of an insect's wing, and we find only pictures within pictures
  as the powers increase; the very pigments used turn out to be jewels, not
  rough uncut stones, but cut and graven gems, bedded in softest
  velvet.</p>

  <p>If by gentle rubbing with the finger-tip the scales be removed from
  both sides of the wing (for each side is scale-covered, though generally
  with a very different pattern), there remains a transparent membrane like
  that of a bee's or fly's wing, tight stretched between stiff branching
  veins, but bearing no vestige of its late gay painting, thus showing that
  the whole of the colouring resides in the scales, the places occupied by
  the roots of the latter being marked by rows of dots.</p>

  <p>Hitherto we have been looking at these scales as the component parts
  of a picture, like the <i>tesseræ</i> of mosaic work; but they are no
  less interesting as individual objects, when viewed microscopically. To
  do this, delicately rub off a little of the dust or scales with the
  finger; then take a slip of glass, and pressing the finger with the
  adhering dust upon it, the latter will come off and remain on the glass,
  which is then to be placed under the microscope. These scales may be
  treated either as opaque or transparent objects, and in both conditions
  display exceeding beauty, some of these single atoms showing, by aid of
  the microscope, as <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>much complexity of structure as the whole
  wing does to the unassisted vision.</p>

  <p>A few of the highly varied forms they present are shown on <a
  href="#plateII">Plate II</a>. Figs. 23 to 38 are selected from among the
  commoner forms, as seen by a comparatively low power. The small
  stalk-like appendage is the part by which the scale is affixed to the
  wing: it may be called the root. Figs. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, show some very
  remarkable forms, which are, so far as has been ascertained, peculiar to
  butterflies of the <i>male</i> sex, though the use or reason of this
  masculine badge, only visible to highly magnifying optics, is neither
  known nor probably to be known at present; but singularly beautiful and
  curious they are to look at. The little balls at the end of threads are
  the root portion, and fit into cup-like sockets, placed here and there
  among the ordinary scales. The surface of these scales is beautifully
  ribbed and cross-ribbed, and at the upper end is a plume-like tuft of
  delicate filaments. The curious scale aptly called, from its shape, the
  Battledore scale, and shown at fig. 22, also belongs to the male of
  various butterflies, especially those pretty little ones known as the
  "Blues." Its surface is most curiously ornamented with rows of bead-like
  prominences.</p>

  <p>Probably one would imagine that in such wee specks as are these
  scales, one single layer of substance would suffice for their whole
  thickness (if we can talk of <i>thick</i>ness, with objects almost
  immeasurable in their <i>thin</i>ness). But such is not the case, for
  when scales have <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>been injured by rubbing we now and then find
  a part with the sculptured surfaces torn off on each side, showing a
  plain central layer, so that at least three layers&mdash;two ornamented
  and one plain&mdash;go to form a filmy body, only a small fraction of the
  thickness of paper.</p>

  <p>But there are other portions of a butterfly to claim our interest
  besides its wondrous wings.</p>

  <p>On the creature's head are grouped together some most beautiful and
  important organs. The most peculiar of these is the long spiral "sucker,"
  which extracts the honied food from the blossoms to which its wings so
  gracefully waft it. This organ is shown, slightly magnified, at fig. 8,
  <a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>., and a most delicate piece of animal
  mechanism it is. Any human workman would, to a certainty, be not only
  puzzled, but thoroughly beaten, in an attempt to construct a tube little
  thicker than a horse-hair, yet composed throughout its length of two
  distinct pieces, capable of being separated at pleasure, and then joined
  again so as to form an air-tight tube. This redoubtable problem, however,
  is solved in the construction of this curious little instrument that
  every butterfly carries.</p>

  <p>The junction of the two grooved surfaces that form the tube is
  effected by the same contrivance that reunites the web of a feather when
  it has been pulled apart. We all know how completely it is made whole
  again, and on examining by what means this result is brought about, we
  find that it is by the interlacing of a <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>number of small fibres or
  hairs, just as, on a larger scale, a pair of brushes adhere when pressed
  face to face; and so in the butterfly's sucker, the two edges that join
  to form the tube are closely set with minute bristles that, when brought
  together, interlock so closely as to make an air-tight surface.</p>

  <p>Fig. 9, <a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>., is a transverse section
  taken near the base of the sucker, the small opening at the top being the
  food passage, those at the side the air-tubes that supply air for
  respiration and perhaps assist in suction.</p>

  <p>The tube is probably made with separable parts in order that if its
  interior should become at any time clogged by grosser particles drawn up
  with the flower nectar, it may be opened and cleansed by the insect;
  otherwise, the tube once rendered impassable, the insect would speedily
  starve, as this narrow channel is the only inlet for the creature's
  nourishment&mdash;its only mouth, in fact, for no butterfly possesses
  jaws to bite with, or can take any but the liquid food pumped up by
  suction through this pipe.</p>

  <p>At the end of the proboscis&mdash;or, as it is called scientifically,
  the Haustellum<a name="NtA3" href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&mdash;there
  are visible in some butterflies a number of small projections, of the
  form shown at fig. 10, <a href="#plateII">Plate II</a>., which is a
  highly magnified figure of the end of the Red Admiral's proboscis. These
  appendages are generally supposed to be organs of taste, <!-- Page 27
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>and to aid in
  the discrimination of food when the pipe is unrolled and thrust down deep
  into the nectary of a flower.</p>

  <p>The <i>compound eye</i> of a butterfly, wonderful as its structure is,
  does not greatly differ from that of many other insects, being like them
  composed of an immense number of little lenses set together to form a
  hemisphere large in comparison with the insect's head. A portion of one
  of these eyes forms a pretty and interesting object for the microscope,
  presenting a honey-comb appearance, the hexagonal lines that mark the
  division of the lenses being most beautifully geometrical and regular in
  their arrangement. More than seventeen hundred of these lenses have been
  counted in a single eye, and each of these is considered to possess the
  qualities of a complete and independent eye. If this be true, the
  butterfly may be said to be endowed with at least thirty-four thousand
  eyes!</p>

  <p>There exist also, as in other insects, <i>two simple</i> eyes, placed
  on the top of the head, but so buried in down and scales as to be neither
  visible, nor useful for vision as far as we can perceive; probably the
  creature finds that his allowance of thirty-four thousand windows to his
  soul lets in as much light as he requires.</p>

  <p>Every one looking at a butterfly must have remarked its long horns,
  called <i>antennæ</i>,<a name="NtA4" href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> which
  project from above the eyes, like jointed threads, thickening&mdash;in
  some <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>species gradually, in others
  suddenly&mdash;into a club or knob at the extremity; a peculiarity which,
  it will be remembered, was pointed out at the commencement, as a
  prominent mark of distinction between butterflies and moths.</p>

  <p>Very graceful appendages are these waving <i>antennæ</i>, and
  evidently of high importance to their owner; but still, their exact
  office or function is unknown, notwithstanding that many guesses and
  experiments have been made with a view of settling that question.</p>

  <p>Investigators have perhaps erred, by assuming at the outset that these
  antennæ <i>must</i> be organs of some sense that we ourselves possess;
  whereas, I think that there is much evidence to show that insects are
  gifted with a certain subtle sense, for which we have no name, and of
  which we can have as little real idea, as we could have had of the
  faculty of sight, had all the world been born blind.</p>

  <p>For example; if you breed from the chrysalis a female Kentish Glory
  Moth, and then immediately take her&mdash;in a closed box, mind&mdash;out
  into her native woods, within a short space of time an actual crowd of
  male "Glories" come and fasten upon, or hover over, the prison-house of
  the coveted maiden. Without this magic attraction, you might walk in
  these same woods for a whole day and not see a single specimen, the
  Kentish Glory being generally reputed a very rare moth; while as many as
  some 120 males have been thus decoyed to their capture in a few hours, by
  the charms of a couple of lady "Glories," shut up in a box.</p>

  <p><a name="plateV"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/i_046.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_046.png"
      alt="V." title="V." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span></p>

  <p>Now, which of our five senses, I would ask&mdash;even if developed
  into extraordinary acuteness in the insect&mdash;would account for such
  an exhibition of clairvoyance as this?</p>

  <p>May not, then, this undiscovered sense, whatever may be its nature,
  reside in the antennæ? for it is a remarkable fact, that the very moths,
  such as the Eggers, the Emperor, the Kentish Glory, &amp;c., which
  display the above-mentioned phenomenon most signally, have the <i>antennæ
  in the males</i> amplified with numerous spreading branches, so as to
  present an unusually large sensitive surface. This seems to point to some
  connexion between those organs and the faculty of discovering the
  presence, and even the condition, of one of their own race, with more,
  perhaps, than a mile of distance, and the sides of a wooden box,
  intervening between themselves and their object.</p>

  <p>Whilst writing this, the current number of the "Entomologist's Weekly
  Intelligencer" has arrived, and I there read that Dr. Clemmens, an
  American naturalist, has been lately experimenting on the antennæ of some
  large American moths, for the purpose of gaining some information as to
  their function. The article, though very interesting, is too long for
  quotation here; but it appears that with the moths in question, a
  deprivation of the whole, or even part of the antennæ, interferes with,
  or entirely annihilates the power <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>of flight, so that the
  creature when thus shorn, but not otherwise injured, if thrown into the
  air seems to have no idea of using his wings properly, but with a
  purposeless flutter tumbles headlong to the earth. Still this merely goes
  to prove that the antennæ are the instruments of some important sense,
  one of whose uses is to guide the creature's flight; but as many wingless
  insects have large antennæ, this evidently is not their only
  function.</p>

  <p>The antennæ are also often styled the "feelers;" but with our present
  incomplete knowledge of their nature, the former term is preferable, as
  it does not attempt to define their use as the word "feelers" does.</p>

  <p>Considerable variety of form exists in the clubbed tip of the antennæ
  in various butterflies, as will be seen by reference to <a
  href="#plateII">Plate II</a>., where three of the most distinct forms are
  shown considerably magnified. Fig. 12 is the upper part of the antenna of
  the High-brown Fritillary (<i>Argynnis Adippe</i>), the end suddenly
  swelling into a distinct knob. Fig. 13 is that of the Swallow-tail
  Butterfly (<i>Papilio Machaon</i>), the enlargement here being more
  gradual; and fig. 14 is that of the Large Skipper Butterfly (<i>Pamphila
  Sylvanus</i>), distinguished by the curved point that surmounts the club.
  These differences in the forms of the antennæ are found to be excellent
  aids in the classification of butterflies, and I shall therefore have
  occasion to refer to them more minutely in describing the insects in
  detail.</p>

  <p>The stems of these organs are found to be tubular, <!-- Page 31
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>and at the point
  of junction with the head the base is spread out (as shown at fig. 15),
  forming what engineers call a "flange," to afford sufficient support for
  the long column above.</p>

  <p>The <i>legs</i> are the last portions of the butterfly framework that
  require especial notice, on account of a peculiar variation they are
  subject to in different family groups.</p>

  <p>It may be laid down as an axiom, that <i>all true insects have six
  legs</i>, in one shape or another; and butterflies, being insects, are
  obedient to the same universal rule, and duly grow their half-dozen legs;
  but in certain tribes the front pair, for no apparent reason, are so
  short and imperfect as to be totally useless for walking purposes, though
  they may possibly be used as hands for polishing up the proboscis,
  &amp;c. So the butterfly in this case <i>appears</i>, to a hasty
  observer, to have only <i>four</i> legs.</p>

  <p>This peculiarity is a constant feature in several natural groups of
  butterflies, and therefore, in conjunction with other marks, such as the
  veining of the wings and the shape of the antennæ, its presence or
  absence is a most useful mark of distinction, in classifying or searching
  out the name and systematic place of a butterfly.</p>

  <p>WHAT BUTTERFLIES NEVER DO&mdash;GROUNDLESS TERROR&mdash;A
  MISTAKE&mdash;USES OF BUTTERFLIES&mdash;MORAL OF BUTTERFLY
  LIFE&mdash;PSYCHE&mdash;THE BUTTERFLY AN EMBLEM OF THE SOUL&mdash;THE
  ARTIST AND THE BUTTERFLY.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Among the <i>negative</i> attributes of butterflies, I may state
  positively, that <i>no butterfly whatever can either sting or bite in the
  least degree</i>; and from their total harmlessness towards the person of
  man, conjoined with their outward attractiveness, they merit and enjoy an
  exemption from those feelings of dread and disgust that attach to many,
  or, I may say, to almost all other tribes of insects; even to their
  equally harmless near relatives the larger moths. At least, it has never
  been my misfortune to meet with a person weak-minded enough to be afraid
  of a butterfly, though I have seen some exhibit symptoms of the greatest
  terror at the proximity of a large Hawk-moth, and some of the
  thick-bodied common moths&mdash;"Match-owlets," the country folk call
  them.</p>

  <p>Once, also, I listened to the grave recital&mdash;by a classical
  scholar too&mdash;of a murderous onslaught made by a Privet Hawk-moth on
  the neck of a lady, and how it "<i>bit a piece clean out</i>." Of course
  I attempted to prove, by what seemed to me very fair logic, that the <!--
  Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>moth,
  having neither teeth nor even any mouth capable of opening, but only a
  weak hollow tongue to suck honey through, was utterly incapable of biting
  or inflicting any wound whatever. But, as is usual in such cases, my
  entomological theory went for nothing in face of the gentleman's
  knock-down battery of <i>facts</i>&mdash;<i>ocular</i> facts; he had
  <i>seen</i> the <i>moth</i>, and he had <i>seen</i> the <i>wound</i>:
  surely, there was proof enough for me, or any one else. So, I suppose, he
  steadfastly believes to this day, that the moth was a truculent,
  bloodthirsty monster; whilst I still presume to believe, that if any
  wound was caused at the moment in question, it was by the nails of the
  lady attacked, or her friends, in clutching frantically at the terrific
  intruder; who, poor fellow, might have been pardoned for mistaking the
  fair neck for one of his favourite flowers (a <i>lily</i>, perhaps),
  while the utmost harm he contemplated was to pilfer a sip of nectar from
  the lips he doubtless took for rosebuds.</p>

  <p>Utilitarians may, perhaps, inquire the <i>uses</i> of
  butterflies&mdash;what they do, make, or can be sold for; and I must
  confess that my little favourites neither make anything to wear, like the
  silkworm, nor anything to eat, like the honey-bee, nor are their bodies
  saleable by the ton, like the cochineal insects, and that, commercially
  speaking, they are just worth nothing at all, excepting the few paltry
  pence or shillings that the dealer gets for their little dried bodies
  occasionally; so they are of no more use than poetry, painting, and
  music&mdash;than flowers, rainbows, and all such <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>unbusinesslike things. In
  fact, I have nothing to say in the butterfly's favour, except that it is
  a joy to the deep-minded and to the simple-hearted, to the sage, and,
  still better, to the child&mdash;that it gives an earnest of a better
  world, not vaguely and generally, as does every "thing of beauty," but
  with clearest aim and purpose, through one of the most strikingly perfect
  and beautiful analogies that we can find throughout that vast Creation,
  where&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All animals are living hieroglyphs."<a name="NtA5" href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The butterfly, then, in its own progressive stages of caterpillar,
  chrysalis, and perfect insect, is an emblem of the human soul's progress
  through earthly life and death, to heavenly life.</p>

  <p>Even the ancient Greeks, with their imperfect lights, recognised this
  truth, when they gave the same name, Psyche (<span title="Psuchê" class="grk"
  >&Psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#x1F75;</span>), to the soul, or spirit of life, and
  to the butterfly, and sculptured over the effigy of one dead the figure
  of a butterfly, floating away, as it were, in his breath; while poets of
  all nations have since followed up the simile.</p>

  <p>And this analogy is not only a mere general resemblance, but holds
  good through its minute details to a marvellous extent; to trace which
  fully would require volumes, while in this place the slightest sketch
  only can be given.</p>

  <p>First, there is the grovelling caterpillar-state, <!-- Page 35
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>emblematical of
  our present imperfection, but yet the state of preparation and increase
  towards perfection, and that, too, which largely influences the future
  existence.</p>

  <p>Many troubles and changes are the lot of the caterpillar. Repeated
  skin-shiftings and ceaseless industry in his vocation are necessary, that
  within his set time he may attain full growth and vigour.</p>

  <p>Then comes a mighty change: the caterpillar is to exchange his
  worm-like form and nature for an existence unspeakably higher and better.
  But, as we have seen, to arrive at this glory there is only one
  condition, which is, that the creature must pass through another, and, as
  it might seem, a gloomy state&mdash;one anything but cheerful to
  contemplate; for it must cease to eat, to move, and&mdash;<i>to the
  eye</i>&mdash;<i>to live</i>. Yet, is it really dead now, or do we, who
  have watched the creature thus far, despair and call it lost? Do we not
  rather rejoice that it rests from its labours, and that the period of its
  glorification is at hand?</p>

  <p>In the silent chrysalis state then our <i>Psyche</i> sleeps away
  awhile, unaffected by the vicissitudes around it; and, at last, when its
  appointed day arrives, bursts from its cerements, and rises in the air a
  winged and joyous being, to meet the sun which warmed it into new life.
  Now it is a <i>butterfly</i>,&mdash;bright emblem of pleasure
  unalloyed.</p>

  <p>This happy consummation, however, is only for the chrysalis which has
  not within it the devouring worm, the fruit of the ichneumon's egg,
  harboured during the <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>caterpillar state&mdash;and emblem, in the
  human soul, of some deadly sin yielded to during life, and which
  afterwards becomes the gnawing "worm that dieth not." For in this case,
  instead of the bright butterfly, there issues forth from the
  chrysalis-shell only a swarm of black, ill-favoured flies, like a troop
  of evil spirits coming from their feast on a fallen soul.</p>

  <p>If a caterpillar were gifted with a foreknowledge of his butterfly
  future, so far transcending his inglorious present, we could imagine that
  he would be only impatient to get through his caterpillar duties, and
  rejoice to enter the chrysalis state as soon as he was fitted for it. How
  short-sighted then would a caterpillar appear who should endeavour, while
  in that shape, to emulate the splendour of the butterfly by some wretched
  temporary substitute, adding a few more, or brighter stripes than nature
  had given it; or, again, if one whose great change was drawing near,
  should attempt to conceal its visible approach by painting over the
  fading hues of health, and plastering up the wrinkles of its outward
  covering, so soon to be thrown off altogether; instead of striving for
  inward strength and beauty, which would never decline, but be infinitely
  expanded in the butterfly&mdash;and regarding the earthly beauty's wane
  as the dawn of the celestial.</p>

  </div>
<p><!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span></p>

  <p>With these and similar reflections before us (which might be
  multiplied <i>ad infinitum</i>), we shall no longer look upon the
  caterpillar as a mere unsightly and troublesome reptile, the chrysalis as
  an unintelligible curiosity, and the butterfly as a pretty painted thing
  and nothing more; but regard them as <i>together</i> forming one of those
  beautiful and striking illustrations with which the book of Nature has
  been so profusely enriched by its <span class="sc">Great Author</span>;
  not to be taken as <i>substitutes</i> for His revealed Word, but as
  harmonious adjuncts, bringing its great truths more home to our
  understandings, just as the engravings in a book are not designed as
  substitutes for the text, but to elucidate and strengthen the ideas in
  the reader's mind.</p>

  <p>While the poet draws from the butterfly many a pleasant similitude,
  and the moralist many a solemn teaching, the artist (who should be poet
  and moralist too) dwells upon these beings with fondest delight, finding
  in them images of joy and life when seen at large in the landscape, and
  rich stores of colour-lessons when studied at home in the cabinet.</p>

  <p>The owners of many a name great in the arts have been enthusiastic
  collectors of butterflies. Our distinguished countryman, Thomas Stothard,
  was one of their devotees, and the following anecdote, extracted from his
  published life, shows how he was led to make them his special
  study:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He was beginning to paint the figure of a reclining sylph, when a
  difficulty arose in his own mind how best to represent such a being of
  fancy. A friend who was present said, 'Give the sylph a butterfly's wing,
  and then you have it.' 'That I will,' exclaimed Stothard; 'and to be
  correct I will paint the wing <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>{38}</span>from the butterfly itself.' He sallied
  forth, extended his walk to the fields, some miles distant, and caught
  one of those beautiful insects; it was of the species called the Peacock.
  Our artist brought it carefully home, and commenced sketching it, but not
  in the painting room; and leaving it on the table, a servant swept the
  pretty little creature away, before its portrait was finished. On
  learning his loss, away went Stothard once more to the fields to seek
  another butterfly. But at this time one of the tortoise-shell tribe
  crossed his path, and was secured. He was astonished at the combination
  of colour that presented itself to him in this small but exquisite work
  of the Creator, and from that moment determined to enter on a new and
  difficult field&mdash;the study of the insect department of Natural
  History. He became a hunter of butterflies. The more he caught, the
  greater beauty did he trace in their infinite variety, and he would often
  say that no one knew what he owed to these insects&mdash;they had taught
  him the finest combinations in that difficult branch of
  art&mdash;colouring."</p>

  <p>The above doubtless has its parallel in the experience of many
  artistic minds, whose very nature it is to appreciate to the full the
  perfections set forth in a butterfly, admiring&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The mention of butterflies "in the cabinet" leads at once to the
  question, how to get them there; or, in other words, <span class="sc">How
  to catch a Butterfly</span>.</p>

  <p>This is a question often less difficult to answer in words than in
  action, for many of our butterflies are gifted not only with strong
  prejudices against the inside of a net, but with very strong powers of
  escaping from that unpleasant situation. Still, by aid of proper
  apparatus, a sure eye and hand, and often, of a good pair of legs, there
  is no butterfly, however fleet and wary, that we may not feel ourselves a
  tolerable match for.</p>

  <p>Firstly, then, as to the out-door apparatus required.</p>

  <p>This is simple enough, a <i>net</i> and <i>pocket-boxes</i>, with a
  few <i>pins</i>, being the only essentials.<a name="NtA6"
  href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span></p>

  <p>Variously constructed nets are used, according to fancy, but the
  choice may lie between two chief forms: the <i>Clap-net</i> and the
  <i>Ring-net</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/i_061.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_061.png"
      alt="Nets." title="Nets." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The former certainly gives more power in a fair chase, but the latter
  has the advantage of being the <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>lighter, more portable, and less conspicuous
  of the two. Both of these instruments are shown in the accompanying
  figures.</p>

  <p>The clap-net (fig. 1) usually has the sticks that compose the
  framework made each in three separate pieces, joined by ferrules&mdash;a
  couple of light fishing-rods will do excellently, a piece of bent cane
  being substituted for the top joint. The manner in which the gauze is
  extended between, and fitted on, these rods will be sufficiently obvious
  on looking at the cut, which represents the net half open. In taking an
  insect, one handle is held in each hand, the net opened wide, and thrown
  over, or made to intercept the insect, when, by suddenly closing the
  handles together, a closed bag is made, and the little prisoner is
  secured.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:12%;">
      <a href="images/i_062.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_062.png"
      alt="Frame for a ring-net." title="Frame for a ring-net." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The ring-net (fig. 2), which is the implement most generally in vogue,
  may be constructed in several ways. The cheapest, and at the same time a
  highly serviceable one, is made by getting from a tinman a tin "socket"
  of this form, the larger end fitting on to the end of a straight stick,
  and the two smaller tubes receiving the ends of a hoop of cane, which
  carries the net, it being passed through a loose hem round the top of the
  latter. The cane, taken out of the socket, can be rolled up closely with
  the net and carried in the pocket to the scene of action, while the
  handle may be a strong common walking-stick, a <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>most useful auxiliary in
  getting across country, and thus this net becomes really no incumbrance
  to the tourist, who may have other matters in hand besides butterfly
  hunting&mdash;perhaps sketching and botanizing&mdash;when the larger
  clap-net becomes quite embarrassing.</p>

  <p>Another form of this net has the ring made of <i>metal</i>, and
  <i>jointed</i> in several places, so as to fold within a small pocketable
  compass, and arranged to screw into a brass socket on the top of the
  stick. This is a very commendable net&mdash;not so easily home-made as
  the last, certainly, but it can be readily procured complete from the
  London dealers (or "naturalists," as they style themselves).</p>

  <p>A net that has been a good deal used of late opens and shuts on the
  umbrella principle, and with the same celerity, forming a ring-net when
  open&mdash;when shut going into a case like that of an umbrella.</p>

  <p>Some entomologists, nervously sensitive to public opinion, are,
  however, somewhat shy of sporting these umbrella nets, for should rain
  perchance come down while he is on the road, the villagers may be
  astonished at the insane spectacle of a man scuttling along through the
  torrent and getting drenched through, while he carries a good-looking
  umbrella carefully under his arm for fear it should get wet; and if, on
  the other hand, the weather be fine, the carrying such a protective would
  seem an equally eccentric whim. But only the <i>very</i> thin-skinned
  would be driven from the use of a good weapon by such a harmless
  contingency as I have here supposed. <!-- Page 43 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

  <p>Other necessary equipments for the fly-catcher are two or three
  <i>light wooden boxes</i>, as large as can conveniently be carried in the
  pockets, and having either the bottom, or, if deep enough, both bottom
  and top lined with a layer of <i>cork</i>, about one-eighth of an inch in
  thickness.</p>

  <p>A pin-cushion, well furnished with <i>entomological pins</i>, should
  also be carried, and will be found to be most accessible when suspended
  by a loop and button (or otherwise) inside the breast of the coat.</p>

  <p>The pins here mentioned, which are an important item among
  butterfly-collecting requisites, are of a peculiar manufacture&mdash;very
  small-headed, long and thin, but strong. Any good London dealer will
  supply them on application, or send them by post into the country.</p>

  <p>Armed with the above simple <i>paraphernalia</i>, viz. net to catch,
  boxes and pins to contain and detain, the insect hunter may sally forth
  on any fine summer's day, with a pretty sure prospect of sport, and the
  chance, at least, of a prize. Much depends, however, on the choice of a
  day, and the nature of the locality that is to form the hunting
  ground.</p>

  <p>As to weather, it must be remembered that winged insects have a great
  objection to face a north, or north-east wind, during the prevalence of
  which you will probably find hardly one stirring, however prolific the
  locality may at other times be.</p>

  <p>Butterflies, as a rule, do not appear to be at all <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>influenced by an
  eye for the picturesque and romantic in the choice of their favourite
  haunts. Often have I been disappointed in this way, finding a delicious
  spot, basking in sunshine, and bedight with all manner of flowers such as
  a butterfly loves, yet with scarcely a stray butterfly to enliven it;
  while, on the other hand, a piece of the most unpromising flat waste land
  will be all alive with insect beauty. Those, for example, who would see
  those splendid creatures, the Swallow-tail butterfly and the large Copper
  (if this exists with us at all now), must go to the dreary fen districts
  that form their almost exclusive haunts.</p>

  <p>It is, in fact, very hard to say what influences bring a swarm of
  butterflies together, to populate one particular spot, to the utter
  neglect of others close at hand, and, to all appearance, just as
  eligible.</p>

  <p>Some species are most remarkable for their excessive <i>localness</i>
  (as it is called), or, limiting their range to an exceedingly small
  circumscribed space; so much so, that some rare species have been known
  to haunt just one corner of one particular field, year after year, while
  not a single specimen could be found in all the neighbouring fields,
  though precisely similar, to all appearance. This phenomenon is quite
  inexplicable with regard to insects endowed so pre-eminently with
  locomotive powers as butterflies are.</p>

  <p>The local nature of his game should, however, induce the collector to
  leave no nook or corner unexplored when he is "working" a district; as
  the passing over (or rather, neglecting to <i>pass over</i>) a single
  field may lose him the very species it would joy him most to find.</p>

  <p><a name="plateVII"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/i_066.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_066.png"
      alt="VII." title="VII." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span></p>

  <p>I would also advise the beginner&mdash;and, indeed, all but the very
  experienced hands&mdash;to catch, not necessarily for slaughter, but for
  inspection, every attainable individual whose species he cannot
  positively declare to when on the wing, lest he pass by some rarities
  unawares. Thus the valued Queen of Spain, and the much-disputed
  <i>Dia</i> Fritillaries, the <i>Melitæas</i>, the Brown Hair-streak, and
  (on the mountains) the rare <i>Erebias</i>, perhaps some new to this
  country,&mdash;any of these might be mistaken by a novice for some of the
  commoner brown species. Among the "Whites," too, the Black-veined White,
  that great prize, the Bath White, and the white varieties of the Clouded
  Yellow and Clouded Sulphur, might share the same fate, or fortune rather,
  of being reckoned as "Cabbage Whites."</p>

  <p>Then, with the "Blues." Who is there that could at once distinguish
  with certainty the very rare Mazarine Blue (<i>P. Acis</i>) from the
  common Blues when on the wing? Perhaps it would turn out to be less rare
  than supposed, if all the Blues in a fresh locality were netted as they
  came near, and set at liberty after passing muster.</p>

  <p>Why, only last season a very curious Blue,<a name="NtA7"
  href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> never before observed in this country, was
  captured near <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>Brighton by a collector, who, at the moment,
  thought it was only a Common Blue, so precisely similar did it look when
  flying.</p>

  <p>As to the manipulation of the net, it will be better to leave the
  young collector to find that out for himself, which, if he has the use of
  his hands, he will quickly do when he gets into the field. He will soon
  perceive that with most of the swifter butterflies, it is of no use to
  make a rush at them. A surprise answers better than a charge; for they
  easily take alarm at open violence, and then go off straight ahead at a
  pace that renders pursuit, over bad ground especially, most trying, if
  not hopeless work. So the "<i>suaviter in modo</i>" principle is best
  here as elsewhere:&mdash;gently follow up and watch your butterfly till
  he pauses over or settles upon a flower, or whatever it may be; then,
  with caution, you can generally come within striking distance without
  giving alarm, and one vigorous, well-aimed stroke usually settles the
  matter; if, after that, he is outside of your net instead of in, you will
  find it a difficult matter to get another chance, at least, with most of
  the larger and strong-flying kinds. But there is much diversity of
  disposition among these creatures, and some are unscared by repeated
  attacks. These points of character the collector will soon learn when he
  has been among these lively little people for a season.</p>

  <p>The different species have also their own favourite positions, on
  which they delight to perch.</p>

  <p>Thus the Clouded Yellow loves the low flowers of <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>the railway-bank and the
  down; often seen toying with a breeze-rocked flower as yellow-coated as
  himself, as though he had mistaken it, in its fluttering, for one of his
  mates.</p>

  <p>Then the Peacock and Red Admiral are attached to several plants of the
  composite order, such as the thistles, teazle, and above all (as far as I
  have observed), to that fine, stalwart plant that frequently abounds in
  thickets, &amp;c., and known as Hemp Agrimony (<i>Eupatorium
  cannabinum</i>). I seldom, at the proper season, visit a clump of this
  growing in a sunny opening, without finding, besides a store of other
  insects, one or both of these grand butterflies enthroned on the ample
  purplish flower-heads, and <i>fanning</i> their gorgeous wings, after the
  custom of their genus, then launching into the air, and, after a few
  circling evolutions in that element, returning to the self-same
  flower-heads, their chosen seats.</p>

  <p>Both of these flies are easily captured when in this position, as they
  allow a near approach, and can be without hindrance swept off by a rapid
  side-stroke of the net.</p>

  <p>The glorious Purple Emperor is celebrated for his predilection for a
  throne on the oak, though some other lofty trees, such as the ash, are
  occasionally honoured by the imperial presence; but his habits and
  <i>locale</i> will be referred to more particularly hereafter.</p>

  <p>That lovely butterfly, the Silver-washed Fritillary, has a
  <i>penchant</i> for settling on the bramble, which <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>justifies the preference
  by proving itself the insect's best friend; but withal a most provoking
  opponent to his would-be captor, who may get him safely within the net's
  mouth at the first stroke, when, ten to one, the trusty bramble-hooks
  clutch into the gauze, and effectually prevent the quick turn of the net
  that should close it, while the prisoner, seeing his chance, darts out
  with a sharp rustle that one's irritated feelings easily interpret into a
  derisive laugh.</p>

  <p>But experience will in time teach the fly-catcher the required
  adroitness to avoid this humiliating defeat.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Having complied with the old adage, "First catch your hare," the next
  point naturally is&mdash;how to cook it. So, having caught our butterfly,
  what are we to do with him?&mdash;a question that generally resolves
  itself firstly into</p>

<p class="cenhead">HOW TO KILL A BUTTERFLY.</p>

  <p>This truculent sentence may, I fear, look like a blot on the page to
  some tender-hearted reader, and, in truth, this killing business is the
  one shadow on the otherwise sunshiny picture, which we would all gladly
  leave out, were it possible to preserve a butterfly's beauty alive; but
  this cannot be done, and yet we have made up our minds to possess that
  beauty&mdash;to collect butterflies, in short; there is but one way for
  it, and so a butterfly's pleasure must be shortened for a few <!-- Page
  50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>days, to add
  to our pleasure and instruction, perhaps for years after.</p>

  <p>In the time of the great Ray, in such mean repute was the science of
  entomology held, mainly, I believe, on account of the <i>small size</i>
  of its objects, that an action at law was brought to set aside the will
  of an estimable woman, Lady Glanville, on the ground of <i>insanity</i>,
  the only symptom of which that they could bring forward in evidence was
  her <i>fondness for collecting insects</i>!</p>

  <p>But this was some two centuries ago, and matters have greatly mended
  for the entomologist since then. Now he may collect butterflies, or other
  flies, as he pleases, without bringing down a commission "<i>de
  lunatico</i>" on his <i>head</i>, but still the goodness of his
  <i>heart</i> is sometimes called in question, and he has to encounter the
  equally obnoxious charge of <i>cruelty</i> to the objects of his
  admiration&mdash;that, too, from intelligent and worthy friends, whose
  good opinion he would most unwillingly forfeit.</p>

  <p>He, therefore, is naturally most anxious that those friends should be
  led to share his own conviction, that the pursuit of entomology&mdash;the
  needful butterfly killing and all included&mdash;may be not only not
  cruel, but actually beneficent in theory and practice.</p>

  <p>So I will briefly try to act as apologist for the "brotherhood of the
  net," myself included.</p>

  <p>In the first place, I will state roundly my sincere belief that
  <i>insects cannot feel pain</i>. This is no special pleading, or "making
  the wish the father to the thought," <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>but a conviction founded
  on an ample mass of evidence, on my own observations and experiments, and
  strengthened by analogical reasoning. I wish I had space to lay this
  evidence in full before the reader; but this being here impracticable, I
  will not damage the argument by taking a few links out of a chain of
  facts which depend on their close connexion with each other for their
  strength and value.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one fact which may be taken by itself, and goes a
  long way in our favour, that I must mention here.</p>

  <p>Insects, when mutilated in a way that would cause excessive pain and
  speedy death to vertebrate animals, afterwards perform all the functions
  of life&mdash;eating, drinking, &amp;c. with the same evident
  <i>gusto</i> and power of enjoyment as before. Plenty of striking
  instances of this are on record, and, as an example, I have seen a wasp
  that had been snipped in two, afterwards regale himself with avidity upon
  some red syrup, which, as he imbibed, gathered into a large ruby bead
  just behind the wings (where the stomach should have been); but really
  the creature's pleasure seemed to be only augmented by the change in his
  anatomy, because he could drink ten times his ordinary fill of sweets,
  without, of course, getting any the fuller. I could almost fancy a
  scientific epicure envying the insect his ever fresh appetite and
  gastronomic capabilities.</p>

  <p>After all that can be said on this subject, there will still probably
  be misgivings in the mind of many, both <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>as to the question of
  insect feelings and also as to our right to shorten their existence, even
  by a painless death.</p>

  <p>As to the first point, we have now the means of giving any insect an
  utterly painless quietus, be it capable of feeling pain or no.</p>

  <p>In regard to the second, I think few will deny that man enjoys a
  vested right to make use of any of the inferior animals, even to the
  taking of their life, if the so doing ministers to his own well-being or
  pleasure, and practically every one assumes this right in one way or
  another. Game animals are shot down (and they assuredly <i>do</i> feel
  pain), not as necessaries of life, but confessedly as luxuries. Fish are
  hooked, crabs, lobsters, shrimps perish by thousands, victims to our
  fancies. Unscrupulously we destroy every insect whose presence displeases
  us, harmless as they may be to our own persons. The <i>aphides</i> on our
  flowers, the moths in our furs, the "beetles" in our kitchens&mdash;all
  die by thousands at our pleasure. Then, if all this be right, are we not
  also justified in appropriating a little butterfly life to ourselves, and
  does not the mental feast that their after-death beauty affords us at
  least furnish an equal excuse for their sacrifice with any that can be
  urged in favour of any animal slaughter, just to tickle the palate or
  minister to our grosser appetites? To this query there can be, I think,
  but one fair answer, so we may return with a better face to the question,
  "How to kill a butterfly."</p>

  <p><a name="plateVIII"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/i_076.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_076.png"
      alt="VIII." title="VIII." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span></p>

  <p>I have alluded above to a painless mode of doing so, doubtless
  applicable to all insects. I know it answers admirably with the large
  moths, so tenacious of life under other circumstances. This potent agent
  is <i>chloroform</i>, whose pain-quelling properties are so well known as
  regards the human constitution.</p>

  <p>There is a little apparatus<a name="NtA8"
  href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> constructed for carrying this fluid safely
  to the field, and letting out a drop at a time into the box with the
  captured insect, taking care that the drop does not go on to the insect.
  Or a wide-mouthed bottle may be used, having at the bottom a pad of
  blotting-paper, or some absorbent substance, on which a few drops of
  chloroform may now and then be dropped. The insect being slipped into
  this, and the stopper or hand being placed over the bottle's mouth,
  insensibility (in the insect) follows immediately, and in a few minutes,
  at most, it is completely lifeless.</p>

  <p>But the usual and quickest mode of despatch is by <i>a quick nip
  between the finger and thumb applied just under the wings</i>, causing,
  for the most part, <i>instantaneous death</i>: and this can be done
  through the net, when the <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>inclosed butterfly shuts his wings, as he
  usually does when the net wraps round him.</p>

  <p>Now take one of your thin pins, and pass it through the thorax of the
  butterfly, while open or shut, and put it into the corked lining of your
  pocket-box. So secured, the butterfly will travel uninjured till you
  reach home; but a heap of dead butterflies in a box together will, in the
  course of a long walk, so jostle together, as to entirely destroy each
  other's beauty, rubbing off all their painted scales, when, of course,
  they are as butterflies no longer.</p>

  <p>When you get home, take out all the pins, excepting such as may be
  stuck <i>perpendicularly</i> through the <i>middle of the thorax</i>, and
  as soon as possible proceed to "set" your captures.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/i_079.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_079.png"
      alt="Setting-board." title="Setting-board." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Preparatory to this, some articles called <i>setting-boards</i> must
  be provided. A section of one of these is shown in the accompanying cut;
  but in reality they are made much longer, so as to accommodate a column
  of half-a-dozen butterflies or more: the breadth may vary, <!-- Page 55
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>according to the
  width of the butterflies that are to be set thereon.</p>

  <p>The bottom is usually a thin slip of deal, on which are glued two
  strips of cork, bevelled off towards the edges, with a slightly curved
  face. Sometimes, however, the whole board is made of soft pine, with a
  groove planed down the middle, and with care will answer pretty well; but
  the corked board is far preferable.</p>

  <p>The mode of "setting" the insect with card "braces" transfixed with
  pins, which retain the wings in their proper position, will be also
  readily seen by reference to the figure.</p>

  <p>A great point in "setting" is to take care that all the wings are
  symmetrically arranged, or diverging from the body at equal angles on
  each side. Let the <i>antennæ</i> also be carefully preserved, as on
  their integrity much of the specimen's value depends.</p>

  <p>It will be needless to say that any handling of the <i>wings</i> is to
  be avoided, as a touch will sometimes destroy their bloom.</p>

  <p>The setting-board, when filled, should be put away into a secure,
  dust-proof, and dry place; and in a few days, more or less, according to
  the dryness or otherwise of the atmosphere, the butterflies will have
  dried and set in their positions, and are then ready for transference to
  the store-box or cabinet.</p>

  <p>The choice of this receptacle is a serious question for the beginner,
  who is often in want of a guide to the judicious expenditure of his
  money, if money he means <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>to spend in this pursuit. To preserve
  insects, it is <i>not</i> absolutely necessary to have either a cabinet
  or the regularly-made store-boxes; for, with a little contrivance, any
  close-shutting, shallow box may be extemporized into a store-box. The
  bottom may either be lined with sheet-cork (such as is used by
  shoemakers)&mdash;which, however, is a rather dear commodity&mdash;or
  common wine-corks may be sliced up, and cut into little square patches
  that may be attached in straight rows to the bottom of the box with
  strong gum or other cement. The first specimens, the nucleus of the
  future great collection, can be kept here well enough, till a real
  cabinet can be compassed.</p>

  <p>A cabinet, however, need not be bought all at once; it may be arranged
  to grow with the collection&mdash;and, it may be, with the collector
  too&mdash;by having one or two drawers made at a time; till, in course of
  time, a sufficient number is obtained, when the whole may be fitted into
  a case at a small additional expense, and then there is a first-rate
  cabinet complete; for, to make this plan really advantageous, the drawers
  should be well made and of good material. Of course, all the drawers must
  be made to the same "gauge," to insure perfect fitting when the cabinet
  is made up.</p>

  <p>These drawers may be made by any clever joiner, but as their
  construction is peculiar, and not easily described, it is necessary,
  either that the maker should be accustomed to this speciality, or that he
  be furnished with a pattern, either by buying a single drawer at a
  dealer's, <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>where that can be done, by borrowing one out
  of a friend's cabinet, or by making therefrom a good working drawing (in
  section, &amp;c.).</p>

  <p>The glasses which cover in the drawers should always have separate
  frames for the more perfect exclusion of dust and mites.</p>

  <p>Well seasoned mahogany or deal may be the material for the drawers,
  but on no account let them be of cedar, a material often used by ignorant
  or unprincipled makers, to the great detriment of the collection, and
  mortification of the collector, as resinous matter after a short time
  exudes from the pores of this wood, dropping down on to the glasses below
  in a gummy shower, and the effluvium seems to condense upon the contained
  insects, whose wings are gradually discoloured and disfigured by greasy
  looking blotches. The drawers are lined at bottom with cork, covered with
  <i>pure white</i> paper, which should be attached with <i>thin</i>
  paste.</p>

  <p>The butterflies are then to be arranged in the drawers in
  perpendicular columns, and in accordance with some system of
  classification. If there be room it is well to have a considerable number
  of specimens of each species, especially when it is one liable to much
  variation. At least one of each sex should always be given, and also one
  of each sex showing the <i>under</i> surface. When the chrysalis can be
  procured, that also should be pinned down with its fellow-butterfly, and
  a good coloured drawing of each caterpillar would be a valuable addition
  to the series. Between the columns, lines should be <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>ruled varying in distance
  according to the breadth of the butterflies, and small labels should be
  pinned down at the foot of each species giving its <i>specific</i> name;
  the name of the genus being placed at the head of the <i>first</i>
  species of the genus. The names of the families and sub-families under
  which the <i>genera</i> are classed are also generally given in their
  respective places.</p>

  <p>I have in this little work followed the system of classification used
  in the <i>public</i> collection of British butterflies at the British
  Museum, which seemed to me more intelligible and natural when applied to
  our very limited number of butterflies, than did the system of Doubleday
  adopted in the great world-wide collection which exists in the private
  entomological room of the British Museum.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the first-mentioned arrangement of all the
  British species under their respective genera, sub-families, and
  families. The most authentic of the <i>reputed</i> species are also here
  inserted in their proper places.</p>

  <p>It will be seen by the above list that seventy species are given as
  British. Of these, five species, viz. <i>Papilio Podalirius</i>,
  <i>Erebia Ligea</i>, <i>Argynnis Dia</i>, <i>Chrysophanus Chryseis</i>,
  and <i>Polyommatus B&oelig;ticus</i>, have been so rarely taken as to be
  refused a place among the <i>regular</i> denizens of our island. So that
  we can only reckon up the small number of <i>sixty-five species of true
  British butterflies</i>.</p>

  <p>These it now remains to describe individually, but, prior to entering
  on that task, I would say a few words <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>on the acquirement of
  scientific nomenclature and systematic arrangement, a knowledge of which
  will facilitate even our recreations in natural history, while it is
  absolutely essential to carrying out the really scientific study of any
  department.</p>

  <p>It is true, that the painting of a butterfly and the fragrance of a
  flower can give deep pleasure to a mind quite unconscious of their Latin
  names, their genus, order, or anything of the kind; but the interest of
  natural objects is, I am sure, greatly augmented when we acquire some
  insight, however dimly, into the wonderful mechanism of creation's plan,
  its infinite gradation of forms, and their curious, subtle relationships,
  to which a <i>good</i> system of classification serves, in some degree,
  as an index. I say, "<i>in some degree</i>," as a system framed in
  perfect accordance with that of nature is a discovery rather to be
  desired than hoped for, with the limited knowledge at present permitted
  to us.</p>

  <p>Though these Latin names are generally considered as unwelcome
  excrescences on the pages of <i>popular</i> natural history works, I
  would yet advise the young entomologist to master them for once, and
  accustom himself well to their use. He will not find the task a very
  difficult one, if I may judge from the repeated instances in which I have
  heard the almost infantile progeny of my naturalist friends glibly
  mouthing these redoubtable words, and applying them with the most precise
  accuracy.</p>

  <p>Among collectors it is customary in familiar <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>conversation to use only
  the second, or <i>specific</i> name of the insect's Latin title; thus, in
  speaking of the common Swallow-tailed Butterfly, they call it
  "<i>Machaon</i>" only, which at once distinguishes the one they mean from
  the other, or scarce Swallow-tailed Butterfly, which they would speak of
  as "<i>Podalirius</i>." The Pearl-bordered Likeness Fritillary may be
  called "<i>Athalia</i>," and so on. I think it will be allowed that these
  Latin names are not harder to learn, remember, or pronounce, than the
  long-winded English titles; and, when acquired, bring their possessor the
  advantage of being able to converse with precision on their subject with
  all naturalists, whether British or Continental; for these names of
  science are current in all European languages.</p>

  <p>Another piece of advice is: don't <i>waste time</i> in trying to
  puzzle out the <i>meaning</i>, the why or the wherefore of butterflies'
  scientific names. Now and then, certainly, they have some allusion to the
  insect's appearance, or to the plant on which it feeds; thus, for
  instance, <i>Gonepteryx Rhamni</i>, the entomological name of the
  Brimstone Butterfly, means the "<i>Angle-winged</i> (butterfly) <i>of the
  Buckthorn</i>," and this is very appropriate and descriptive; but in
  general there is no more connexion between the name and the character of
  a butterfly, than there is between a ship's name&mdash;the
  "<i>Furious</i>," the "<i>Coquette</i>," or the "<i>Pretty Jane</i>," as
  it may be&mdash;and the moral disposition or personal appearance of the
  vessel that bears it.</p>

  <p>Also, don't <i>waste money</i> and encourage dishonesty, by <!-- Page
  62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>giving the
  absurdly large prices put upon <i>British</i>, or <i>pretended</i>
  British specimens of butterflies, or other insects that are rare in this
  country though common on the Continent; when, for all purposes of
  science, or the pleasure derived from their beauty, <i>avowed</i>
  Continental specimens, at one-twentieth of the price, will do just as
  well. In putting these into your cabinet, however, always attach to the
  pin underneath the insect a label, bearing some mark to denote the
  specimen's foreign origin.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE BRITISH BUTTERFLIES SEPARATELY DESCRIBED.</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLY. (<i>Papilio Machaon.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>There is no possibility of mistaking this noble insect for any other
  of our native species, after a glance at its portrait. Its superior size,
  conjoined with the possession of a pair of <i>long</i> tails on the hind
  wings, would at once mark it distinctly, independently of the peculiar
  markings and colour.</p>

  <p>In the colouring of the wings, a broad simplicity prevails, the
  general ground-tint being a clear creamy yellow, with the bars and
  marginal bands of the deepest velvety black. The broad bands of black on
  the front wings are powdered towards the centre with <i>yellow</i>
  scales, and those on the hind wings with <i>blue</i> scales. The only
  other colour on this side is a spot of rust-red at the inner angle of the
  hind wings.</p>

  <p>The under side is very similar in colouring to the upper, but the
  black markings are less decided and sharp, and there are several
  additional rust-red spots on the hind wings. <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which is a very handsome creature, is found
  feeding on various umbelliferous plants; among which, its chief
  favourites in this country appear to be the Wild Carrot (<i>Daucus
  Carota</i>), the Marsh Milk-parsley (<i>Selinum palustre</i>), and Fennel
  (<i>Anethum F&oelig;niculum</i>). In colour it is bright green, with
  velvet-black rings, which are spotted with red. A distinguishing mark of
  this caterpillar is a reddish-coloured forked appendage just behind its
  head, which, when the animal is alarmed, gives out a strong-scented
  fluid, supposed to be for the purpose of alarming some of its
  enemies.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i>, again, is a very pretty object, especially when
  of its ordinary colour, which is a lively green, shaded in some parts
  into bright yellow; but there is a frequent variety marked only with
  various shades of brown and buff. Living specimens of both of these are
  before me at this moment, and when they assume the perfect state, I shall
  be curious to mark whether these differences are continued in the
  respective butterflies.</p>

  <p>These chrysalides are most interesting objects to keep during the
  winter months. As the spring advances, the colours of the butterfly begin
  to appear faintly through their thin green envelope, and the pattern of
  the upper wings, which only are visible, becomes at last distinctly
  perceptible, of course in miniature. When this is the case, we should
  begin to watch for the release of the beautiful prisoner.</p>

  <p>If you visit his cage the first thing every morning (for his exit most
  frequently takes place in the early part of <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>the day), you may be
  fortunate enough on one of these occasions, to find the creature either
  actually emerging, or just out of his case; cutting an odd figure, and
  evidently neither very proud of himself nor much at his ease, his wings
  being tiny things, hardly bigger than those of a humble-bee, and hanging
  limply from his comparatively ponderous and gigantic body; which they are
  nevertheless destined, ere many hours are over, to carry with most
  enviable celerity through the air.</p>

  <p>The rapid increase in size of these organs is a matter of marvel; you
  can literally see them grow, and within about an <i>hour</i> they will
  have reached their full expanse. The creature attaches itself, back
  downwards, to the lid of its cage, or to the under side of any convenient
  <i>horizontal</i> surface, that the wings, by their own weight, may aid
  in their dilatation, and that they may dry without creasing, as they will
  sometimes do, when the insect, being under a slippery bell-glass, for
  instance, is unable to reach the desirable point of suspension, which it
  always evinces extreme anxiety to do. By the time the sun is well out,
  our pet will have his wings thoroughly plumed for flight; and here a
  difficulty sometimes presents itself to the entomologist. What is to be
  done with our new-born Machaon? It is probably a splendid specimen for
  the cabinet, and the collector may long to grace his "series" with its
  virgin splendours. But then there will creep over him the unwelcome
  sensation, that it is a somewhat cowardly proceeding to foster a bright
  being into a life that might be all joyousness, <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>and then, taking
  advantage of his domesticated position, to cut short that life, almost
  ere commenced, and to forbid those wondrous wings to carry their
  possessor to even one short day's enjoyment of sunshine and nectar, and
  the doubtlessly exalted pleasure of mere airy motion itself. Fairly
  chasing down a butterfly is all well enough; but this is quite another
  thing.</p>

  <p>Every one must, however, choose for himself, as to taking the
  sentimental or the entomological view of the matter.</p>

  <p>Each probably finds its followers, and to the occasional prevalence of
  the more tender sentiment, are probably owing many of those stray
  Swallow-Tails that turn up here and there in unlikely places.</p>

  <p>The chrysalides, for rearing, may be obtained in the autumn or winter,
  either from entomologists resident in the localities of the butterfly, or
  more generally and certainly from the London or Cambridge dealers, who
  will send them into the country by post for a few pence each.</p>

  <p>The flight of this species is rapid and powerful, and it has a habit
  of soaring loftily.</p>

  <p>In this country its head quarters are in the fens of Cambridgeshire,
  Norfolk, and Huntingdonshire. It has been found in some abundance near
  Cambridge, Norwich, Yaxley, Whittlesea Mere, Burwell, and Hornsey Fens;
  also singly in Lancashire, at Battersea, Pulborough in Sussex, near
  Ashford in Kent, at Balcombe, Isle of Wight, Hampshire, near Chatham, at
  Southend, Essex, and on the Cliffs of the South Coast. <!-- Page 67
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span></p>

  <p>From its local character, this is of course one of the species that
  the collector can hardly expect to meet with, except he live in one of
  the districts given above as its head quarters. In these, however, it is
  abundant enough, and the first sight of a number of these grand insects
  on the wing must be enough to gladden the eye of any naturalist.</p>

  <p>This butterfly comes out first in May, and is met with from that time
  till August.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE BRIMSTONE BUTTERFLY. (<i>Gonepteryx Rhamni.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>Though one of the commonest of our native butterflies, this, like
  numberless other very common things, is also one of the loveliest, both
  in the graceful outline of its wings, and in the lively hue that
  overspreads their surface; charms the more to be appreciated, as this
  insect is one of the few that do not wait for the full bloom of summer
  ere they condescend to make their appearance, but in the earliest, chill
  months of spring, and even in the dead winter season, the country rambler
  is sometimes gladdened by its gay flight; and in fact there is not one
  winter month that is not occasionally enlivened by this flying flower,
  when a day of unwonted mildness and sunshine tempts it from its winter
  retreat. <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span></p>

  <p>Until very recently it had always been stated by entomologists, that
  the Brimstone Butterfly was "double-brooded" (a term meaning that it went
  through <i>two whole cycles of existence</i>, from the <i>egg</i> to the
  <i>perfect insect</i>, in <i>one year</i>), one brood appearing in May,
  and the other in the autumn.</p>

  <p>But it is now established, on very satisfactory evidence, that <i>one
  brood only is produced, and that, the autumnal one</i>. A considerable
  number of these survive the winter in some place of concealment, and
  coming out again in the spring form the so-called spring brood. Many of
  these hybernators are found to be in very fair condition in the spring,
  but in general they lack the perfect freshness and bloom of those taken
  in autumn; the wings of those I have taken at this period are often
  semi-transparent, from having lost feather, and frequently are spotted
  and discoloured, as if by mildew; a sign probably of their owners having
  wintered in damp lodgings.</p>

  <p>Mr. Douglas states that they get very fat and full of honey before
  consigning themselves to their long winter's sleep; evidently an
  instinctive provision against the waste of substance that must of
  necessity accompany all, even the most sluggish vitality: in this respect
  following the same instinct that leads bears, and other hybernating
  animals, to fatten up to their utmost stretch before retiring for the
  season.</p>

<p><!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>eggs</i> should be sought for in the month of May, or a little
  earlier or later, on the buds and young shoots of the two species of
  Buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus Frangula</i> and <i>R. Catharticus</i>). When
  examined with the microscope, these are found to be very pretty objects
  of conical form, with sculptured ribs on the sides.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> that results from these, when it grows up, is
  of a fine green colour, shagreened over with black points, and shading
  off into a paler line along the side. Its shape is represented at <a
  href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig. 2. It is found on the <i>young</i>
  buckthorn foliage that forms its food.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is of the remarkable shape shown on <a
  href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig. 13,&mdash;green, marked with yellow. It
  remains in this state for about twenty days, when the perfect butterfly
  appears.</p>

  <p>The general colour of the male Brimstone Butterfly is a clear,
  brilliant yellow, much like that of the Daffodil, its contemporary; and
  in the centre of each wing is a small spot of rich orange-colour. A very
  beautiful feature to be remarked in this butterfly is the silken mane, so
  to speak, composed of long hairs of silvery gloss and whiteness, which
  are arranged as if combed up from the sides of the thorax, so as to meet
  in a crested form over the top.</p>

  <p>The female chiefly differs from the male in the ground colour of the
  wings, which are of a pale and very peculiar greenish white tint, rather
  more deeply tinged with yellow at the extremities of the wings.</p>

  <p>As the male, from his colour, bears the name of "Brimstone," or
  "Sulphur," the complexion of his mate may be accurately compared to the
  tint of another <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>sulphureous preparation, called by druggists
  "milk of sulphur."</p>

  <p>The only noticeable variation this butterfly is subject to in this
  country is in the size of the orange wing-spots, which are sometimes
  greatly enlarged.</p>

  <p>In a well-marked variety, common in the south of Europe, Madeira,
  &amp;c., this enlargement reaches a great development, nearly the whole
  of the <i>upper</i> wings being suffused with a deep orange, though in
  all other respects the insect does not differ from our common form. This
  beautiful variety has been described as a different species under the
  name of <i>Gonepteryx Cleopatra</i>; but M. Boisduval has proved that
  they are identical, by rearing both the ordinary <i>Rhamni</i> and the
  <i>Cleopatra</i> from the same batch of eggs.</p>

  <p>The female <i>Cleopatra</i> does not differ materially from
  <i>Rhamni</i>. I look on this variety as very interesting, as a probable
  instance of the direct effect of increased warmth of climate in
  intensifying colour.<a name="NtA9" href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Plentiful as this butterfly is in all the southern counties, and
  extending in more or less abundance as <!-- Page 71 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>far northwards as the
  lake district, it there becomes scarce; and I can find no instance of its
  having occurred in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Of course, its prevalence in any district is naturally regulated by
  the abundance of its food-plants, the buckthorns.</p>

  <p>Gardens, fields, and lanes are equally the resort of this favourite
  insect; and there the newly-hatched specimens are to be found on the wing
  from August to October.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE CLOUDED YELLOW, OR CLOUDED
SAFFRON. (<i>Colias Edusa.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>. fig. 3, Male; 3<span class="scac">A</span>, Female.)</p>

  <p>This richly-coloured and nimble-winged fly is ever the darling of the
  collector. None make a finer show in the cabinet, and few tempt pursuit
  more strongly than does this golden beauty when on the wing.</p>

  <p>For many years past, and up to quite a recent period, the appearance
  of this butterfly in any abundance was a phenomenon only occurring at
  uncertain periods, separated by intervals of several years. In one
  season, perhaps, hardly a solitary specimen would be seen, and in the
  very next, a swarm of them would spread over the southern counties,
  delighting the fly-catcher and puzzling the naturalist to find a
  sufficient reason for <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span>this sudden burst of insect-life. Whether
  the eggs lay dormant for years, till hatched under peculiarly favourable
  conditions; or whether every now and then a few individuals were tempted
  to cross the Channel from the Continent by some attraction unknown to us,
  or were, <i>nolens</i>, <i>volens</i>, blown hither by the wind, and then
  deposited eggs which produced the next year's troop of butterflies; or,
  lastly, whether an agency was at work here, of whose nature we are
  entirely ignorant,&mdash;all these are questions that still remain to be
  answered. There is, I believe, no foundation for the opinion sometimes
  held by entomologists, that this species prevails at <i>regular</i>
  periods, such as once in four, or once in seven years. In fact, for the
  last two or three years its permanent residence and appearance among us
  seems to be established, while, at the same time, its northward range has
  been greatly extended, a considerable number having been taken even <i>in
  Scotland</i>&mdash;its existence in that country having been previously
  quite unheard of.</p>

  <p>The environs of London, especially on the south side, have been
  abundantly visited by this charming insect; but its tastes have a
  decidedly maritime tendency, and we find it has a marked preference for
  the <i>South Coast</i>; abounding, again, more especially towards the
  eastern end. Its favourite resorts are clover and lucerne fields, though
  dry flowery meadows, open downs, and the sides of railway-banks are also
  the scenes of its lively flight&mdash;for <i>Edusa</i> has indeed a
  lively flight, and his pursuer has need of the "seven-league boots," with
  the hand of <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>Mercury, to insure success in the fair open
  race, if that can be called a fair race at all, between a heavy biped,
  struggling and perspiring about a slippery hill-side, such as
  <i>Edusa</i> loves,&mdash;and a winged spirit of air, to whom up-hill and
  down-hill seem all one.</p>

  <p>In truth, the best way to get <i>Edusa</i> is to watch and mark him
  down on a flower, then creep cautiously up till within range, raise the
  net quietly, and <i>strike rapidly downwards</i> over the insect, who
  usually darts <i>upward</i> when struck at; and, in nine cases out of
  ten, <i>Edusa</i> will be fluttering under the net. It is not the most
  heroic style of sport, this, but it fills the boxes admirably.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is of a deep green colour, having on each side
  a white line, marked with yellow and orange. It may be sought for in June
  and July, on various plants of the leguminous order, which form its food,
  such as None-such Trefoil (<i>Medicago lupulina</i>), Lucerne (<i>M.
  Sativa</i>), and Clover.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is in shape between that of the Brimstone, and
  Cabbage butterfly, green with a yellow stripe, and rust-coloured
  dots.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> seldom is seen on the wing till July, but August
  is its great season; and it lingers with us till late in autumn.</p>

  <p>I remember the pleasure with which, on a chill, stormy day in October,
  I watched the sports of a pair who were my sole companions while
  sketching, in a remote, rocky nook of the South Welsh coast. Very <!--
  Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>battered
  and weather-worn were the pretty creatures, but still retaining much of
  the golden bloom of their summer dress.</p>

  <p>The Clouded Yellow has been found hybernating in the chink of an old
  wall at the end of February, but I am not aware of its coming out again
  in the spring, like the Brimstone.</p>

  <p>The ground tint of the wings is an exceedingly rich orange-yellow, or
  saffron colour, surrounded by a border of very dark brown, sometimes
  nearly black. This border is marked, in the male, with thin yellow
  <i>lines</i>, and in the female with <i>paler yellow spots</i>. There is
  a beautiful rose tint in the fringe of the wings and on their front edge.
  Underneath the wings are paler yellow, taking a citron hue in some parts,
  and marked with black and brown; in the centre of the under wings is a
  brown-circled silvery spot.</p>

  <p>There is a peculiar and constant <i>variety of the female</i>, in
  which all the yellow portion of the upper surface is replaced by a
  <i>greenish white</i> tint; but in every other respect the insect agrees
  with the common form of <i>Edusa</i>. This interesting variety was
  formerly ranked as another species, under the name of <i>C. Helice</i>;
  but it is a curious fact that no corresponding variety of the male has
  ever been observed; and last year I captured a pair together&mdash;a
  white female and common orange male&mdash;who were on those terms of
  tender intimacy which are generally supposed to betoken identity of
  species. <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span></p>

  <p>Varieties of the female are also met with, of various intermediate
  shades of colour between the white and the ordinary orange.</p>

  <p>Yet is it not possible that all these varieties may be mules between
  <i>C. Edusa</i> and <i>C. Hyale</i> (the next species), the males of
  which are often seen pursuing the lady <i>Edusas</i>? but if so, as
  indeed it would be on any other hypothesis, it is hard to account for the
  unvarying character of the male.</p>

  <p>This butterfly is also called the Clouded Saffron.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead">THE CLOUDED SULPHUR, OR PALE
CLOUDED YELLOW BUTTERFLY. (<i>Colias Hyale.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIII">Plate III</a>. fig. 4.)</p>

  <p>We may, in general, readily distinguish this elegant insect from the
  last species&mdash;the females of which it rather resembles in its
  markings&mdash;by the difference in the ground tint of the wings, which
  in this vary from primrose or sulphur yellow to a greenish white.</p>

  <p>There is, however, some risk of confounding this with the white
  variety of <i>Edusa</i> (<i>Helice</i>), a mistake often committed by
  young entomologists; so it will be well to point out the most prominent
  distinction between the two; and this is easily done, by observing that
  in <i>Edusa</i> the dark border of the upper wings is of nearly <!-- Page
  76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>equal breadth
  along the whole of the outer margin, and <i>at the lower corner is
  continued inwards for a short distance</i>; whilst in <i>Hyale</i> this
  border <i>narrows rapidly, and disappears before reaching the lower
  corner of</i> the wing. Also the dark border of the hind wings is much
  broader in <i>Edusa</i> than in <i>Hyale</i>. Here we have distinctive
  marks, quite independent of the ground colour of the wings.</p>

  <p>The sexes of this butterfly are nearly alike in their markings, the
  chief difference being in the yellower ground tint of the males.</p>

  <p>The same localities&mdash;viz. the south and south-east coast, and the
  adjacent district&mdash;that are most prolific in its near relative,
  <i>Edusa</i>, likewise furnish this species in the greatest plenty; but
  this is by far the rarer species of the two, and, either by coincidence,
  or in obedience to some direct law, several successive periods of its
  abundance have been septennial, or have occurred once in seven years.
  Thus the years 1821, '28, '35, '42, '49, and '56 are noted in
  entomological records as having produced it in great numbers.</p>

  <p>On the coast of France, opposite to our own, it is one of the common
  butterflies, and it is not improbable that it frequently makes the
  passage of the Channel. The maritime habits of both this and <i>Edusa</i>
  are well known, and I have frequently seen the latter flying out to
  seawards, and coquetting with the waves, till the eye could follow the
  golden speck no longer. Taking advantage then of a favouring wind, its
  naturally strong <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>and rapid flight would quickly take it
  across the few miles of sea that separate us from the Gallic shore.</p>

  <p><i>Hyale</i>, whose flight is at least as strong as <i>Edusa's</i>,
  and whose salt-water tastes are similar, doubtless acts in the same
  manner.</p>

  <p>The northward range of this species is more limited than that of
  <i>Edusa</i>, but it has been taken singly near York, Manchester, and a
  few other northern localities. In the lucerne fields near Brighton, a
  dozen or more have been sometimes captured in one day.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is of a sea-green colour, with four yellow
  lines, two along the back and one on each side; and is to be found, in
  June and July, feeding on lucerne and other plants of the same natural
  order.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is very similar to that of <i>Edusa</i>, green,
  with a yellow stripe.</p>

  <p>In this country, the <i>butterfly</i> first appears in August; but on
  the Continent it seems to be double-brooded, being found in May as well
  as in August.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE BLACK-VEINED OR HAWTHORN
BUTTERFLY. (<i>Aporia Cratægi.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>When on the wing, this species might easily be mistaken by the
  inexperienced for the common Cabbage <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>White; and, by virtue of
  this <i>incognito</i>, does in all probability often escape from the
  terrors of the net, which would speedily entrap him, were his real
  character known to the young hunter; for this butterfly is one of those
  called, in entomological slang, "<i>a good thing</i>"&mdash;a term
  expressive neither of superior excellence nor beauty, but meaning that
  the insect can't be met with everywhere, or every day, and when seen is
  always to be caught.</p>

  <p>A closer view, however, shows it to be very distinct from all the
  other "Whites;" its <i>decided black veinings on a milk-white ground</i>,
  in conjunction with its large size, being sufficient for its immediate
  recognition.</p>

  <p>The outline of the wings, as well as the play of the veining lines on
  their surface, is extremely elegant. It will be observed, that instead of
  the feathered fringe that surrounds the wings of most butterflies, they
  are bordered in this species by a stout nervure, forming a sharp black
  outline, and giving a peculiarly chaste finish.</p>

  <p>The under side differs in no mentionable respect from the
  upper&mdash;a very rare circumstance in this tribe. From being very
  sparingly coated with scales, the wings are semi-transparent, differing
  much in this respect from those of the Garden White butterflies.</p>

  <p>The female generally has the veins of the fore wings of a browner tint
  than in the males.</p>

  <p>This butterfly is one of the very local species, though its food
  plants are everywhere to be found, in more or less abundance. <!-- Page
  79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span></p>

  <p>The following localities, among others, have been recorded as
  producing it:&mdash;Herne Bay, and other parts of the Isle of Thanet,
  plentifully; near Faversham, Kent; Horsham, Sussex; New Forest; Brington,
  in Huntingdonshire; near Cardiff, South Wales, plentiful.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars are gregarious, feeding under cover of a silken web.
  The hawthorn and the sloe are its chief food plants in this country, but
  it is here too rare an insect to do much damage. Not so, however, on the
  Continent, where it is extremely common, and is classed among noxious
  insects, committing great devastation among various fruit trees,
  especially the apple, pear, and cherry.</p>

  <p>But even in this country the insect is occasionally met with in great
  profusion, but only in isolated spots. Mr. Drane, writing from Cardiff to
  the <i>Zoologist</i>, says, "In the middle of April (1858) I found the
  <i>larvæ</i> feeding by thousands upon insulated shrubs of <i>Prunus
  Spinosa</i> (Common Sloe), eating out the centres of the unexpanded buds,
  or basking in the sun upon their winter webs."</p>

  <p>The body of the adult <i>caterpillar</i> is thickly clothed with
  whitish hairs, is leaden grey on the side and underneath, black on the
  back, and marked with two longitudinal reddish stripes. Found from the
  middle of April to the end of May.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i>, shown at fig. 14, <a href="#plateI">Plate
  I</a>., is greenish white, striped with yellow and spotted with
  black.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE LARGE GARDEN WHITE BUTTERFLY (<i>Pieris Brassicæ.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>Why this butterfly should so far outnumber every other native species
  (excepting, perhaps, the more rural Meadow Brown), is a question beyond
  our power to answer satisfactorily. Certainly, the food plants of the
  caterpillar&mdash;cabbages, cresses, and their tribe&mdash;are
  universally met with; but then we find there are other insects whose food
  plant is equally plentiful and widespread, and yet they are nevertheless
  very rare or local.</p>

  <p>This is pre-eminently the domestic butterfly, abounding in suburban
  gardens, and at times penetrating into the smoky heart of London, and
  then even the young "St. Giles's bird," whose eyes were never gladdened
  by green fields, gets up a butterfly hunt, and, cap (or rag) in hand,
  feels for the nonce all the enthusiasm of the chase in pursuit of the
  white-winged wanderer, who looks sadly lost and out of place in the
  flowerless, brick-and-mortar wilderness.</p>

  <p>This and the next species are the only British butterflies who can be
  charged with committing any appreciable amount of damage to human food
  and property. In the winged state, indeed, it is utterly harmless (like
  all other butterflies); but not so the hungry caterpillar progeny, as the
  gardener knows too well when he looks <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>at his choice cabbage
  rows all gnawed away into skeletons.</p>

  <p>In some seasons and places they multiply so inordinately and
  prodigiously as to deserve the title of a plague of caterpillars, and
  several remarkable instances of this phenomenon are on record.</p>

  <p>A note in the <i>Zoologist</i>, p. 4547, by the Rev. Arthur Hussey,
  gives us the following:&mdash;"For the last two summers many of the
  gardens of this village have been infested by caterpillars to such an
  extent that the cabbages have been utterly destroyed." When the time for
  changing to the chrysalis state arrived, the surrounding buildings
  presented a curious appearance, being marked with long lines of the
  creatures travelling up the walls in search of a suitable place of
  shelter for undergoing their transformation. A great number of the
  caterpillars took refuge in a malt-house, from which they could not
  escape as butterflies, the result being that for several weeks the
  maltster swept up daily many hundreds of the dead insects.</p>

  <p>In 1842, a vast flight of white butterflies came over from the
  Continent to the coast about Dover, and spreading inland from thence, did
  an immense amount of damage to the cabbage gardens; but so effectually
  did the ichneumon flies do their work, that an exceedingly small
  proportion of the caterpillars, resulting from this flock of immigrants,
  went into the chrysalis state, nearly all perishing just before the
  period of change.</p>

  <p>Those small, silky, oval objects, of yellowish colour, <!-- Page 82
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span>frequently found
  in groups on walls and palings, are the <i>cocoons</i> of these useful
  little flies, spun round about and over the remains of the dead
  caterpillar their victim. "These," as Mr. Westwood observes, "ignorant
  persons mistake for the eggs of the caterpillar, and destroy; thus
  foolishly killing their benefactors."</p>

  <p>Happily these devastating caterpillars have plenty of enemies to
  prevent their continued multiplication, and to reduce their number
  speedily when it exceeds certain limits. Besides the ichneumons,
  mentioned above, the feathered tribes do much towards keeping them down.
  Mr. Haworth, in his "<i>Lepidoptera Britannica</i>," says, with reference
  to this: "Small birds destroy incredible numbers of them as food, and
  should be encouraged. I once observed a titmouse (<i>Parus major</i>)
  take five or six large ones to its nest in a very few minutes. In
  enclosed gardens sea-gulls, with their wings cut, are of infinite
  service. I had one eight years, which was at last killed by accident,
  that lived entirely all the while upon the insects, slugs, and worms
  which he found in the garden."</p>

  <p>The pretty <i>egg</i> of this butterfly is figured on Plate II. fig.
  1: it may be found commonly enough, with a little searching, on
  cabbage-leaves, either at the end of May or beginning of August.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which, besides cabbages, consumes various
  other cruciferous plants,&mdash;also Tropæolums, or, as they are
  erroneously called, "Nasturtiums,"&mdash;is green, <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>shaded with yellow on
  each side, and covered with black points, on each of which is situated a
  hair.</p>

  <p>By way of compensation for the damage it inflicts, it has been
  suggested that a durable green dye might be extracted from the
  caterpillars of cabbage butterflies, since it is extremely difficult to
  eradicate the stain made by a crushed caterpillar on linen. If this
  strange and novel dye should ever take its place among the vagaries of
  fashion, the shopkeepers could find a familiar French name, as the word
  <i>chenille</i>, applied to another commodity, means simply
  "caterpillar," so "<i>chenille green</i>" would be the phrase for the
  colour afforded by smashed caterpillars.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig. 15) may be
  found almost anywhere, laid up under ledges of garden walls, doorway, or
  any convenient projection, not too far from the creature's food. Wanting
  an individual just now, to sit for his portrait, I had only to step out
  of my door, and within a hundred yards espied a candidate for the
  distinction, ready to hand, under the coping-stone of a gate-post.</p>

  <p>A <i>female</i> specimen of the butterfly is figured on Plate IV. fig.
  2. The <i>male</i> may be readily distinguished by the <i>absence of the
  black spots and dashes on the upper side of the front wings</i>.</p>

  <p>The winged insect may be seen throughout the warm season from April to
  August.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SMALL GARDEN WHITE. (<i>Pieris Rapæ.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>Outwardly resembling the last in almost every respect but that of its
  inferior size, this species shares the gardener's malediction with its
  larger, but perhaps less destructive, relative; for the caterpillar of
  <i>Rapæ</i>, though smaller, bores into the very heart of the cabbage,
  instead of being content with the less valuable outer leaves, as
  <i>Brassicæ</i> is. From this pernicious habit the French call this grub
  the <i>ver du c&oelig;ur</i>.</p>

  <p>The colour of this <i>caterpillar</i> is pale green, with a yellow
  line along the back, and a dotted one of the same colour on each
  side.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is nearly like that of the last in shape, but of
  course smaller, and is of a more uniform brownish or yellowish tint.</p>

  <p>This butterfly occasionally multiplies immensely, and is given to
  migrating in vast armies to distant settlements, sometimes crossing the
  sea to effect this purpose. Here is an extract from a Kentish newspaper,
  describing an occurrence of this phenomenon:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"One of the largest flights of butterflies ever seen in this country,
  crossed the Channel from France to England on Sunday last. Such was the
  density and extent of the cloud formed by the living mass, that it
  completely obscured the sun from the people on board our Continental
  steamers, on their passage, for many hundreds of yards, while the insects
  strewed the decks in all directions. The flight reached England about
  twelve o'clock at noon, and dispersed themselves inland and along shore,
  darkening the air as they went. During the sea-passage of the
  butterflies, the weather was calm and sunny, with scarce a puff of wind
  stirring; but an hour or so after they reached <i>terra firma</i>, it
  came on to blow great guns from the S. W., the direction whence the
  insects came."</p>

  <p>A contemporary account states that these were the small white
  butterflies (<i>Pieris Rapæ</i>).</p>

  <p>The smaller butterfly with more dusky markings, formerly known as
  <i>P. Metra</i>, has been recently proved to be merely a variety of
  <i>Rapæ</i>, a Mr. J. F. Dawson having reared a brood of caterpillars all
  <i>exactly similar</i> in appearance, which eventually produced every
  variety of <i>P. Rapæ</i> and <i>P. Metra</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Curtis, in his "Farm Insects," mentions the capture, near Oldham
  in Lancashire, of a male specimen, which had all the wings of a <i>bright
  yellow</i> colour.</p>

  <p>Most juvenile butterfly hunters, unblest by scientific knowledge of
  insect life, imagine that this and the last owe their difference in size
  simply to their being old and young individuals of the same name;
  forgetting&mdash;or, rather, never having heard&mdash;that butterflies
  never grow in the slightest degree after once getting their winged form;
  only as caterpillars do they grow. <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span></p>

  <p>The male is distinguished from the female by having only <i>one round
  black spot</i>, or sometimes none, on each <i>upper</i> wing, whilst the
  female is spotted as in the engraving. The under side of the hind wings
  is dull yellow, lightly powdered with black scales.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is seen during nearly the whole of the summer,
  and is found almost everywhere.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead">THE GREEN-VEINED WHITE BUTTERFLY. (<i>Pieris Napi.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>. fig. 4.)</p>

  <p>Is so called from the greenish tint that <i>often</i> borders the
  veins or nervures on the <i>under</i> side of the <i>hind</i> wing; but
  the name is <i>not always</i> an appropriate one, for a large proportion
  of the specimens met with have the veinings grey, and not at all green;
  but the fact is, that the ground colour varies greatly, from creamy white
  to full buff, or bright clear yellow; in the latter case it is, that the
  minute black scales which border the course of the nervures, covering
  over the yellow, produce a grey-green effect on the eye.</p>

  <p>The size also is very variable. I have a specimen that expands two
  inches and two lines across, from tip to tip, and have seen another not
  larger than a small Copper butterfly&mdash;little more than one inch from
  tip <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span>to tip. The intensity of the dark markings,
  on both the upper and under sides, is also subject to much variation.</p>

  <p>But, under all these circumstances, the presence of dark cloudy veins
  on the under side&mdash;appearing, but less distinctly, on the upper
  side&mdash;will at once distinguish it from the last species, the only
  one with which it can possibly be confounded.</p>

  <p>The <i>male</i> has only <i>one round spot</i> on the <i>front</i>
  wings; the <i>female</i> being marked as in the plate.</p>

  <p>Both in woods and cultivated grounds we meet with this butterfly
  commonly enough, most abundantly in May and July, though it may be found
  from April to August.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> feeds on the same tribe of plants as the two
  last, but is supposed to be especially attached to the Rape (<i>Brassica
  Napus</i>), whence its specific name. Its colour is green, with yellow
  spots round each spiracle, which is itself tinged with red.</p>

  <p>Two varieties of this were formerly ranked as distinct species, under
  the name of <i>P. Sabellicæ</i> and <i>P. Napæ</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE BATH WHITE. (<i>Pieris Daplidice.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIV">Plate IV</a>. fig. 5, Female.)</p>

  <p>Of all the members of this white-winged genus that inhabit Britain,
  this is at the same time the most beautiful and the rarest. The capture
  of a Bath White is an entomological "event," and the day thereof is a
  red-letter day in the fortunate captor's life.</p>

  <p>On the opposite coast of France, however, and generally on the
  Continent, far from being a rarity, this is one of the commonest
  butterflies&mdash;a fact difficult for an English collector, removed by
  only a few miles of sea, to realise, or reconcile with the
  <i>extravagant</i> value and importance attached to a true "British
  specimen."</p>

  <p>The remark made under the head of the Black-veined White, as to that
  eluding the net of the novice, by its resemblance to a common kind, will
  apply with still greater force to this one; for I suppose there are few
  even of the tolerably experienced "hands" who could tell this from the
  two last described insects, at a short distance. One curious circumstance
  bearing on this is, that a large per centage of the Bath White captures
  in this country have been made by juvenile beginners, who hunt and catch
  <i>everything</i> they see, Common Whites and all. <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span></p>

  <p>This fact should encourage the collector, especially when at work on
  the south-east coast, to net all the middle-sized Whites that come within
  reasonable distance&mdash;of course letting them off again, if they are
  not of the right sort.</p>

  <p>The wing markings on both the upper and under sides are, though
  simple, extremely elegant and chaste. The <i>female</i>, which is the sex
  figured, has the upper wings beautifully spotted with black. The hind
  wings are bordered with a <i>row of black spots</i>, and clouded towards
  the centre with a faint tint of the same.</p>

  <p>The male is distinguished by the absence of the black spot nearest to
  the lower margin of the front wing, and of the black marginal spots and
  grey clouding of the hind wings. The markings of the under surface,
  however, show through their substance rather plainly.</p>

  <p>In both sexes, the ground colour of the wings is milk-white. But the
  chief decoration is reserved for the under surface, which is chequered,
  in a manner not easily described, with a soft but rich green tint upon
  white, relieved here and there by a few black touches.</p>

  <p>We are informed by Lewin, that it was named the Bath White from a
  piece of needlework executed at Bath, by a young lady, from a specimen of
  this insect, said to have been taken near that city. But the
  south-eastern corner of England, and more especially on the coast, seems
  to be the head-quarters of this valued fly,&mdash;lending probability to
  the supposition entertained <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>by many, that a large proportion of those
  taken here have migrated or been blown across the Channel; though I
  believe it sometimes breeds here, and that the caterpillars have, on one
  or two occasions, been found in this country.</p>

  <p>The butterfly has been taken several times at Dover, Margate, and
  other places on the Kentish coast; at Lewes; Whittlesea Mere, Cambridge;
  Worcester, and near Bristol.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which is to be found in June and September, is
  bluish with black spots, a pale yellow line on each side, and two of the
  same colour on the back. M. Le Plastrier reared a number of them, feeding
  them on the leaves of the Wild Mignonette (<i>Reseda lutea</i>). It also
  feeds on Weld (<i>Reseda Luteola</i>).</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> very much resembles that of the Small Garden
  White, and is totally unlike that of the next, the Orange-Tip, with which
  it has been by some entomologist united into another genus
  (<i>Manicipium</i>).</p>

  <p><i>Daplidice</i> is a slow insect&mdash;slower than the Common
  Whites&mdash;and it is an easy matter to catch it, when recognized, which
  the peculiarly heavy flight might aid one in doing.</p>

  <p>May and August are the months in which to look after this gem of the
  <i>Pontia</i> genus.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE ORANGE-TIP BUTTERFLY. (<i>Euchloë Cardamines.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>. fig. 1, Male; 1<i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>Few vernal ramblers in the country, whether entomological or no, can
  fail to have noticed, and been charmed by, this merry blossom-like
  insect, as it gaily flits along by hedge-row and wood-side, pausing anon
  to taste its own sweet flowers of May, and looking, even when on the
  wing, so unlike any other of our native butterflies. Truly it is an
  exquisite and loveable little creature, this Orange-Tip&mdash;sometimes
  styled the Wood Lady; but this latter title is somewhat awkward in its
  application, inasmuch as the "<i>lady</i>" insect is entirely without the
  characteristic <i>orange</i> adornment, and would hardly be suspected as
  being the same species with her handsome lord.</p>

  <p>The <i>male Orange-Tip</i> needs no description, for the purpose of
  recognition, beyond that conveyed by his name; but as the <i>female</i>
  is less known, and has been on several occasions mistaken for the rare
  Bath White (<i>Daplidice</i>), it will be well to point out her chief
  distinguishing characters. The difference between the two insects
  certainly is obvious enough, when the two are <i>seen</i> together, but
  their written descriptions read rather alike. <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span></p>

  <p>The female <i>Cardamines</i> has the wings white <i>above</i>, with a
  greyish black tip, and a <i>small oval</i>, or <i>crescent-shaped black
  spot</i> (much smaller than that of Daplidice) near the <i>centre</i> of
  the front wings; <i>beneath</i>, a white ground, with green marblings,
  that are much more sharply defined than those in <i>Daplidice</i>. Near
  the centre of the front wing is a <i>clear black spot</i>, corresponding
  in position with that on the upper surface, <i>and not shaded off with
  green, as in Daplidice</i>.</p>

  <p>We speak of the <i>green</i> marblings of this species&mdash;and, to
  the naked eye, they do appear to be of quite a bright green&mdash;but
  under a microscope or powerful lens that colour disappears, being
  resolved into a combination of bright yellow and pure black scales,
  which, with the dazzling snow-white ground scales that surround them,
  form a microscopic tableau of extraordinary beauty. This can, however,
  only be seen by daylight, for under artificial light the yellow, on which
  the whole effect depends, is entirely lost.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is slightly hairy, and green, with a white
  stripe on each side. It has been generally stated that the <i>Cardamine
  impatiens</i> is the common food plant of this species, <i>apropos</i> of
  which I will quote the following communication from Mr. Doubleday to the
  editor of the <i>Zoologist</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In reply to your query about the food of the larva of
  <i>Cardamines</i>, I may say that I have found it upon several plants. I
  believe that <i>Cardamine pratensis</i> (common cuckoo-flower) is the one
  on which the eggs <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>{93}</span>are most frequently deposited, but the
  greater part of the <i>larvæ</i> must perish in this neighbourhood,
  because the fields are mowed before the larvæ are full-grown. I have very
  often seen the larvæ on the seed-pods of <i>Erysimum Alliaria</i>, and
  have several times found the <i>pupæ</i> on the dead stems of this plant
  in winter; I think that it is the principal food of Cardamines at Epping;
  it also probably feeds on <i>E. barbarea</i>, and other similar plants.
  Some years ago we used to have a quantity of a large single rocket in the
  garden, and there was always a number of the larvæ of <i>Cardamines</i>
  feeding on the seed-pods. <i>Cardamine impatiens</i> is so local a plant
  <i>that it cannot be the common food of the larvæ of Cardamines</i>."</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is of the very singular shape shown at fig. 17,
  <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>., a shape quite unique among British
  butterflies, though that of the next slightly approaches it. It is to be
  looked for in autumn and winter on the dry, dead stems of the plants
  named in the foregoing paragraph.</p>

  <p>The perfect butterfly, which is very common throughout the country, is
  met with from the end of April to the end of May or beginning of
  June.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE WOOD-WHITE BUTTERFLY. (<i>Leucophasia Sinapis.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>A glance at the figure of this graceful little butterfly (on <a
  href="#plateV">Plate V</a>.) will suffice to distinguish it at once, and
  clearly, from all our other Whites. The most ordinary form of the insect
  is there represented, but there are specimens occasionally met with that
  have the blackish spot at the tip of the wings very much fainter; and
  sometimes, as in one that I possess, this spot is totally wanting. The
  shape of the wings in these is also different, being much rounder, and
  proportionately shorter, than in the ordinary shape. This difference in
  outline is, I believe, a sexual distinction, the more rounded form
  belonging to the female insect.</p>

  <p>The slender, fragile wings and the attenuated body of the Wood-white
  give it a look of almost ghostly lightness, and its manners befit its
  spectral aspect, for it seems to <i>haunt</i> the still and lonely wood
  glades, flitting about slowly and restlessly, and being seldom seen to
  settle.</p>

  <p>From its weak flight, it is a very easy insect to capture. It appears
  to be addicted to early rising, <i>twenty-six</i> specimens having been
  taken <i>one morning before breakfast</i> by a gentleman at Grange, in
  North Lancashire. <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, striped on each side with yellow; it
  feeds on the Bird's-foot Trefoil, and other leguminous plants.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is shown on <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig.
  18, and in shape somewhat approaches that of the Orange-tip.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in May and August, and though by no means
  a common or generally distributed insect, is found&mdash;and sometimes
  abundantly&mdash;in many localities throughout the country, as far north
  as Carlisle; some of these are here given. Woods in neighbourhood of
  Brighton, Horsham (Sussex), Dorchester, New Forest, Exeter, Epping, West

<p class="cenhead">THE MARBLED WHITE BUTTERFLY. (<i>Arge Galathea.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>This highly interesting and elegant insect would, by the uninitiated,
  probably be classed among the last group of Butterflies&mdash;the
  Whites&mdash;from the similarity in its colours; but from all those it
  may be readily distinguished by having <i>only four walking legs</i>
  (instead of the <i>six</i> which all our other white butterflies
  possess), <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>and also by the <i>eye-like</i> spots most
  visible on the under side.</p>

  <p>The colouring may be described as consisting of nearly equal
  quantities of <i>black</i> and <i>creamy-white</i>, or <i>pale
  yellow</i>, so arranged as to form a <i>marbled</i> pattern of great
  richness. This description applies to the upper surface; on the under,
  the pale tint very much preponderates, many of the black masses of the
  upper side being here reduced to mere lines.</p>

  <p>Many an entomologist, whose hunting ground has been limited to a small
  district, has collected for years without once seeing this pretty
  creature on the wing; and then visiting another neighbourhood, perhaps
  not far distant, he will suddenly find it in profusion. I well remember
  the feelings of surprised delight with which, under these circumstances,
  I first made its acquaintance. The scene of the event was a grassy
  opening in a wooded hill-side in Kent, and here were literally hundreds
  visible at once, making the air all alive as they fluttered about in
  sportive groups: it was a sight not to be forgotten; while a hundred
  yards from this spot not a solitary one was to be seen, so closely
  limited is the local range of this species.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which feeds on grasses, like the rest of its
  tribe, is green, with yellowish stripes on each side, and has a reddish
  head and tail. The form is shown at fig. 3, <a href="#plateI">Plate
  I</a>.&mdash;a form common to all the tribe to which this species
  belongs.</p>

  <p>July and August are the months when we should <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span>look for this charming
  butterfly, in wood clearings and meadows near woods.</p>

  <p>Some of the localities in which it has been observed are: Isle of
  Wight, Surrey Hills, Eastwell Park (Kent), Dover, Lewes, Brighton,
  Epping, Gloucestershire, Kingsbury, Darenth Wood, New Forest, Rockingham
  Park, Teignmouth, York, Barnwell Wold, South Wales. <i>Not known in

<p class="cenhead">THE SPECKLED WOOD BUTTERFLY. (<i>Lasiommata Egeria.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>. fig. 4.)</p>

  <p>Every one who has wandered through green woodland ridings, or coppiced
  paths, must be familiar with a lively, spotted brown insect that trips
  along just ahead of one, in a sociable way, for some distance, finding
  time to turn aside into the leafy recesses on either side without losing
  ground; then, having had enough of our company, mounting overhead, and
  retracing its course in the same playful way, and soon lost in the
  winding of the path.</p>

  <p>This is the Speckled Wood, or Wood Argus Butterfly, a very pretty
  insect on both sides, and receiving the latter name&mdash;Argus, "the
  many-eyed"&mdash;from the rows of rich black <i>eyes</i> that grace its
  pinions. <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span></p>

  <p>Over nearly the whole of England it is to be met with commonly
  wherever there is wooded ground; but in several parts of Scotland it is
  quite unknown.</p>

  <p>The prevailing colour of the wings is deep brown, spotted with various
  shades of buff or lighter brown. The "eyes" are velvety black, with a
  pure white centre-spot.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>&mdash;a grass feeder&mdash;is dull green, with
  broad white side stripes.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i>, which is of a beautiful grass-green colour, may
  be found in winter, under trees, attached to blades of grass.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is out from April to August.</p>

  <p>The habits and movements of this pretty species much resemble those of
  the last; but the Wall Butterfly is a more sun-loving insect, and rather
  frequents road-sides and dry sunny banks. Still, there are many spots
  where one sees both the <i>Lasiommatas</i> together.</p>

  <p>The colours on the upper side are a <i>rich tawny or fulvous
  ground</i>, with <i>dark-brown markings</i>, and pure <!-- Page 99
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>{99}</span>black eye-spots.
  The under side of the hind wings is pencilled with sober colours, but in
  a design of great beauty and delicacy; and especially to be admired are
  the double-ringed "eyes," a band of which runs parallel with the outer
  margin of the hind wings.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> feeds on grasses; is green, with three pale
  lines down the back, and one more clearly marked on each side.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in May, and again in August and
  September; and is everywhere common throughout the country.</p>

  <p>It is called the Wall Butterfly from its frequent habit of choosing a
  road-side <i>wall</i> for a perch, whence, on the approach of man, it
  darts off; returning again, however, on the departure of the obnoxious
  person.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE GRAYLING BUTTERFLY. (<i>Hipparchia Semele.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateV">Plate V</a>. fig. 6, Female.)</p>

  <p>This fine insect is the largest <i>British</i> species of the genus,
  and also of the family, some of the females measuring two inches and
  three-quarters from tip to tip across the expanded wings; and it also
  exhibits more vivacity of colouring than most of its brethren.</p>

  <p>Above, the wings are deep brown, marked with <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span>broad patches of paler
  colour, sometimes making a bright contrast in the female, but much duller
  and more uniform in the male.</p>

  <p>The female also exceeds her lord considerably in stature, and, in
  fact, by her side he looks rather a mean and shabby fellow.</p>

  <p>The device on the under side of the hind wings, though composed of the
  plainest colours, is very ornamental; grey and brown are the prevailing
  hues, disposed in mottled bars and stripes, reminding one of agates, or
  some other ornamental stones.</p>

  <p>This butterfly is not everywhere to be found, but haunts rocky places
  and hill-sides, on a chalky or limestone soil. At St. Boniface's Down, in
  the Isle of Wight, I noticed it in such exceeding profusion last August,
  that I could quickly have caught thousands, had I been so disposed.</p>

  <p>Though a powerful-looking insect, its flight is by no means swift, and
  it suffers itself to be captured without difficulty.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is dull pinkish about the back, with three
  obscure grey-green stripes, a dark line on the sides, and greenish
  beneath. It feeds on grasses, and has been said to undergo its
  transformation to the chrysalis in the earth; but this point requires
  confirmation.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is seen from the middle of July till the
  beginning of September.</p>

  <p>The following are localities for it:&mdash;Bembridge and Ventnor (Isle
  of Wight), Brighton, Lewes, New Forest, Exeter, Plymouth, Falmouth,
  Truro, Bristol, Dorsetshire, Salisbury Plain, Winchester, Worcester,
  Newmarket, Gamlingay, Isle of Arran, Arthur's Seat (Edinburgh), Durham,

<p class="cenhead">THE MEADOW BROWN BUTTERFLY. (<i>Hipparchia Janira.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>. fig. 1, Male; 1<i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps of all our butterflies this is the least attractive, being too
  common to excite interest from its rarity or difficulty of attainment, as
  other dingy butterflies do, and too plain and homely to win regard, in
  spite of its commonness, as the beautiful "Small Tortoise-shell" and the
  Common Blues do.</p>

  <p>This is the sober brown insect that keeps up a constant fluttering, in
  sunshine and gloom, over the dry pasture land and barren hill-side; and
  perhaps it ought to find favour in our eyes, from this very fact of
  keeping up a cheerful spirit under circumstances the most unfavourable to
  butterfly enjoyment in general.</p>

  <p>The colouring of the <i>male</i>, on the upper side, may be described
  as a <i>sooty brown</i>, rather lighter about the eye-spot on the front
  wing. <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>female</i> is a little smarter in her attire, having an
  orange-tawny patch on the front wing.</p>

  <p>Beneath, both sexes are nearly alike; the general colour of the front
  wing being fulvous, or orange-brown, with a cool-brown margin. The hind
  wings are marked with tints of a duller brown, varying much in
  distinctness in different specimens.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, with a white stripe on each side.
  Feeds on grasses.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> abounds almost everywhere, from June till the end
  of August.</p>

  <p>Though much less abundant than the last, this is another very common
  species, and met with throughout England and the <i>south</i> of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>The ground tint above is a <i>rich rust-colour</i>, or
  <i>orange-brown, bordered with dark-brown</i>; the base of the wings also
  slightly clouded with the same; and on each front wing, near the tip,
  there is a <i>black eye-spot</i>, with <i>two white</i> dots. So far,
  both sexes are similar; but the <i>male</i> has, in addition, a <i>bar of
  dark-brown across the centre of the rust-coloured space</i>, on the upper
  wing. This sex is that figured on the plate. <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span></p>

  <p>Underneath, there is a pretty arrangement of subdued colouring; that
  of the front wings nearly resembling the upper side; the lower wings
  clouded and spotted with russet-brown on a paler brown ground, the
  <i>dark rounded brown spots</i> having <i>white</i> centres; but there
  are <i>no black</i> eye-spots on the hind wings.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is greenish-grey, with reddish head and two
  pale lines on each side and a dark one down the back.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i>, a feeble flier and easily captured, appears in
  July and August; its favourite resorts being heaths, dry fields, and
  lanes.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE RINGLET BUTTERFLY. (<i>Hipparchia Hyperanthus.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>. fig. 3, Female.)</p>

  <p>This is one of those butterflies in which Nature, departing from her
  accustomed plan, has reserved the chief adornment of the wings for the
  <i>under</i> surface, leaving the upper comparatively plain and
  unattractive.</p>

  <p>In both sexes the wings, above, are of a deep sepia brown, surrounded
  by a greyish white fringe, and bearing several black spots in paler
  rings, which rings are <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>much <i>less distinct</i> in the
  <i>male</i> than in the female, the sex figured in the plate.</p>

  <p>The under surface is of a soft russet ground, adorned with a wreath of
  the <i>ringlet</i>-spots from which the insect takes its common name.
  These are <i>black eye-spots</i>, white-centred and set in a clear ring
  of pale tawny colour. The most usual form and proportions of these spots
  are shown in the figure (with closed wings), but there are many varieties
  met with, the following being the most remarkable that have come under my
  notice.</p>

  <p>One, and not a very uncommon one, has <i>no light rings</i> round the
  black spots on the under side.</p>

  <p>Another has the rings reduced to a range of mere light specks, the
  <i>black eye-spots being entirely absent</i>.</p>

  <p>Then again, another has the black <i>pupils</i> exceedingly large and
  rich, forming a most elegant variety.</p>

  <p>The spots on the <i>upper</i> side in the <i>male</i> are sometimes
  quite imperceptible.</p>

  <p>The ground colour of the <i>upper</i> side is occasionally of a pale
  drab or fawn colour.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> of this species is very like that of the last
  in colouring, and feeds on the same grasses.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i>, which is out in June and July, is a common and
  widely distributed species, frequenting woods, shady corners of
  hedge-rows, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SCOTCH ARGUS BUTTERFLY. (<i>Erebia Blandina.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>. fig. 4, Female.)</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Erebia</i>, to which this species belongs, is composed of
  a group of mountain butterflies, very numerous in the Alpine regions of
  the Continent, seventeen species being described as inhabiting the Alps;
  and, though only two have yet been discovered in this country (unless we
  admit <i>Ligea</i>, formerly taken in the Isle of Arran<a name="NtA10"
  href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>), it is not at all improbable that
  others may be waiting for us in some of the mountain districts, if we
  will but look them up. Both tourists and, more especially, residents in
  those localities should be encouraged by the hope of adding a new species
  to our list to explore thoroughly the hill-sides and summits at various
  seasons of the year, as many of the species, besides being extremely
  local in their range, are only on the wing during a very short period of
  the year.</p>

  <p>The Scotch Argus is a pretty, though not brightly-coloured
  butterfly.</p>

  <p>The colour above is a deep rich brown, with a coppery or orange-red
  band on each wing, and each band has several (three or four usually)
  black eye-spots thereon.</p>

<p><!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span></p>

  <p>On the under side, the front wings are nearly the same as on the upper
  side, showing the red patch and eyes plainly; but the hind wings are
  without the red patch, and are divided into broad bands of brownish
  tints, very variable, having sometimes a tendency to chocolate colour,
  sometimes to an olive or russet brown: but the stripe which is shown as
  lightest in the engraving of the under side is almost always greyer than
  the rest, having occasionally a purplish ash colour. On this band are
  some minute specks, occupying the places of the upper surface eyes.</p>

  <p>The number of eye-spots is very variable on both surfaces.</p>

  <p>The female, which is the sex figured, is both larger than the male and
  has the reddish band of a brighter colour.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, whose food plant is unknown, is stated by
  Duncan to be "light green, with brown and white longitudinal stripes;
  head reddish."</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in August and September. A few years ago
  it was esteemed a rare insect, but it has since been found in plenty in
  some of the following localities, the list of which would doubtless be
  largely added to by further research in the northern hilly districts, its
  chosen haunts.</p>

  <p>Near Edinburgh; near Minto, in Roxburghshire; Isle of Arran; Bræmar;
  near Newcastle; Castle Eden Dene; Durham; Craven; Wharfedale. <!-- Page
  107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

  <p>At Grange, in North Lancashire, this "rarity" is a common garden
  butterfly, according to Mr. C. S. Gregson.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE MOUNTAIN RINGLET BUTTERFLY. (<i>Erebia Cassiope.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>. fig. 5.)</p>

  <p>A few years ago this little butterfly was esteemed one of the greatest
  of British rarities. The first well authenticated specimens were
  discovered and captured in Westmoreland by that distinguished artist, T.
  Stothard, R.A.; then for several years no more were taken, and the very
  existence of the butterfly in Britain was questioned. Since that time,
  however, its peculiar haunts among the mountains of Cumberland and
  Westmoreland have been rediscovered, and great numbers have been captured
  by various collectors. It is only found in very elevated situations,
  flying about the moist, springy spots that abound on these mountain
  sides, and in many spots the insect is very plentiful, within a limited
  range.</p>

  <p>Mr. Curtis says, "They only fly when the sun shines, and their flight
  is neither swift nor continued, for they frequently alight among the
  grass, and falling down to the roots, their sombre colour perfectly
  conceals them."</p>

  <p>The following notice of their locality, &amp;c. from <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>personal
  observation, is quoted from a communication to the <i>Intelligencer</i>,
  by a well-known entomologist, Mr. R. S. Edleston, of Manchester. He
  says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I and my friend, Mr. Hugh Harrison, in the middle of June made the
  ascent to Sty Head Tarn; for the first time in my experience, the weather
  was everything we could desire&mdash;calm and sunshine; this, combined
  with the dry season of last year and the long drought for months during
  this, enabled us to collect on ground in other years a dangerous morass.
  The result was, we captured <i>Cassiope</i> in abundance, some of them in
  superb condition, just emerged from the chrysalis. A very short time on
  the wing suffices to injure them. They vary considerably in the
  development of the black spots on the fulvous patch, almost obsolete in
  some through all gradations to the fullest development; the patch varies
  in like manner, and also in form; lastly, they vary in size."</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yet <i>unknown</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> has the wings above of a dark brown colour. Each
  wing bears near its extremity a bar of deep but dull red, divided into
  sections where the brown veins cross. In each section is usually a black
  spot, but sometimes these are absent, and a few red spots take the place
  of the bar. The hind wings are smoothly rounded in their outline, and not
  toothed or scalloped as in the last species (<i>Blandina</i>). The
  <i>males</i> generally appear towards the end of June, but a few
  sometimes earlier. The females, however, come later. <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>being found in
  July, and some even as late as August. The following localities for it
  are recorded:&mdash;Rannoch, Perthshire; Lake District; Sty Head Tarn;
  Langdale Pikes; Red Skrees Mountains, near Ambleside; Gable Hill. But
  other stations for it will probably be added to our list in time.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVI">Plate VI</a>. fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>This species, which is another North-country butterfly, varies so much
  in its colouring of sober drab or brown, with black eye-spots, that its
  varieties have been described as distinct species under the names of
  <i>C. Polydama</i>, <i>Typhon</i>, and <i>Iphis</i>, now, however, all
  placed together under the name of <i>Davus</i>.</p>

  <p>These variations appear to depend in great measure upon local
  differences of elevation, latitude, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>From this excessive variability also it is very difficult to give a
  clear <i>general</i> description of the markings, though the insect may
  be distinguished from other British species that approach it in
  appearance by the obscure yellowish-drab tint of the upper surface,
  marked with indistinct eye-spots, and more especially by having on the
  under surface of the hind wings an <i>irregular</i> <!-- Page 110
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span><i>whitish</i>
  band across the centre, and outside of this a row of about six clearly
  defined black eye-spots with white centres, situated each in a pale
  ochreous ring.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i>, which appears in June and July, is exclusively
  met with in the North (including North Wales), and inhabits the moors and
  marshy heaths, or "mosses," in a great many localities in Scotland and
  the northern counties. The following are among those recorded:&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Scotland.</span>&mdash;Shetland Isles; Isle of Arran;
  Pentland Hills; Ben Nevis; Ben Lomond, near Oban; Ben More.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">England.</span>&mdash;Lake District of Cumberland;

  <p>Ashdown Forest, in Sussex, has been given as a locality, on doubtful
  authority, certainly; but from what I have seen and know of that district
  and its productions, I think it is not at all impossible that
  <i>Davus</i> may be really found there. We have there, at any rate, the
  heath-covered, yet swampy, moorlands that the insect loves, and also in
  plenty the plants one finds most abundant in the northern moorlands; such
  <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span>as Vacciniums, Cotton-grasses, the three
  common Heaths, &amp;c. &amp;c. with great variety in the elevation, some

  <p>This is the pretty little tawny-coloured butterfly that mixes with the
  sportive group of "Blues," Meadow Browns, &amp;c. on heaths, downs, and
  grassy fields.</p>

  <p>The general colour of the upper surface is a tawny yellow or buff,
  shaded with a darker tint of brown at the edges and at the bases of the
  hind wings. On the under side it may be distinguished from <i>C.
  Davus</i> by the <i>absence of the clearly defined black eye-spots</i>
  which the latter has. It is usually much inferior in size to the
  last.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which feeds on the common grasses, is of a
  bright apple-green colour, with three darker green stripes bordered with
  a whitish tint, the largest stripe being that on the back.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>This elegant butterfly is one of those in which the choicest
  ornamentation is bestowed upon the <i>under</i> surface, to the
  comparative neglect of the upper. Above, a dark sepia-brown tint, banded
  and spotted with white, is all that greets the eye; but beneath there is
  a piece of the most exquisitely harmonious colouring, though the hues
  that compose it are still of a subdued and secondary
  nature;&mdash;silvery blue, and golden brown blended with a cooler brown
  and black, are placed in vivacious contrast with bands and spots of pure
  silvery white.</p>

  green general colour, and ornamented with <i>bright silver</i> spots and
  stripes.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is found from the end of June till the end of
  July; its favourite resorts being oak-woods in the southern counties.

  Essex; near Rye, and in other parts of Sussex; at several places in Kent;
  near Winchester; and in Black Park, where Dr. Allchin informs me he took
  a large number in one day.</p>

  <p>The superlatively graceful motions of this butterfly on the wing, as
  it comes floating and sailing through the wood openings, have long been
  celebrated; and the story has been often quoted from Haworth, of the old
  fly-fancier, who, long after he had become too feeble and stiff-jointed
  to pursue or net a butterfly, used to go and sit on a stile which
  commanded a well-known resort of his favourite <i>Sybilla</i>, and there,
  for hours together, would he feast his eyes on the sight of her
  inimitably elegant evolutions.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE PURPLE EMPEROR. (<i>Apatura Iris.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>By universal suffrage, the place of highest rank among the butterflies
  of Britain has been accorded to this splendid insect, who merits his
  imperial title by reason of his robe of royal purple, the lofty throne he
  assumes, and the boldness and elevation of his flight.</p>

  <p>A glimpse of this august personage on the wing is enough to fire the
  collector with enthusiastic ambition <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>for his capture;
  sometimes a matter of the easiest accomplishment, sometimes just as
  hopelessly impossible, according to his majesty's humour of the
  moment.</p>

  <p>Cowardice is not one of his attributes, and if he has formed a
  preference for any especial spot, he will risk loss of liberty and life
  rather than forsake it.</p>

  <p>The old mode of capturing this prize was by a ring net fixed at the
  end of a pole some twenty or thirty feet long, and so sweeping him off as
  he sat on his leafy throne, or in one of his evolutions when he quitted
  his seat for a turn in the air.</p>

  <p>This method still is practised, and succeeds occasionally, but the
  weapon is an unwieldy one, both in use, and for carriage to the place of
  action; and science has now placed in our power another plan, by means of
  which I believe that by far the greater number of recent captures have
  been made.</p>

  <p>The plan alluded to, is to take advantage of the creature's royal
  taste for game&mdash;for in that light I take his predilection for
  decomposing animal matter, now a matter of notoriety; and so potent is
  the attraction of the <i>haut-goût</i> for the royal palate, that if any
  animal, or part of one, not too recently slaughtered, be suspended near
  the known haunts of the insect, ten to one but its savour will bring him
  down to earth to taste the luxurious morsel, and so engrossed does he
  become when thus engaged, that he may be swept off by the net without
  difficulty. In the space of two or three days large numbers of Emperors
  have been caught by means <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>of this novel and singular trap, and the
  seemingly coarse and unbutterfly-like taste that leads them to it.</p>

  <p>The wings of the male only have that splendid glow of changing purple
  that gives him his name and honours, the empress having in its place a
  sober garb of brown; she, however, considerably exceeds her lord in
  dimensions and expanse of wing. From her stay-at-home habits, sitting all
  day in her oak-leaf bower, she is comparatively seldom seen or captured.
  I believe collectors generally take about ten males to one female.</p>

  <p>On the under side the colouring of both sexes is similar, and affords
  a striking contrast to the dark upper surface, having the white markings
  arranged as on the upper side, but rather broader; and, instead of the
  dark brown or purple, a lively pattern of orange-brown, greyish brown,
  and black. On the front wing is a purple-centred eye-spot, and a smaller
  one is seen near the lower angle of the hind wing.</p>

  <p>The firm, muscular appearance of the wings, gives promise of great
  strength in those organs, fully borne out in the powerful and bird-like
  flight of the creature, who has also a habit of soaring, about midday, to
  vast heights in the air, and there engaging in contests, sportive or
  pugnacious, with his brother, or rival, Emperors.</p>

  <p>In the <i>caterpillar</i> state also the Purple Emperor is a
  remarkable creature, of the form shown in <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.
  fig. 5, bright green, striped with yellow on each side, and bearing on
  his head a pair of horns or tentacles. <!-- Page 116 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>Though the perfect
  insect is chiefly found on the oak, the caterpillar feeds generally on
  the broad-leaved Sallow, though it has been occasionally found on the

<p class="cenhead">THE PAINTED LADY. (<i>Cynthia Cardui.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVII">Plate VII</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>We now come to a very natural group of butterflies, rich, and often
  gorgeous, in their colouring, and having, both in their perfect and
  preparatory states, many characteristics in common, in point of habits,
  as well as of appearance and construction. The caterpillars are all
  thorny, and the chrysalides are adorned with brilliant metallic
  (generally <i>golden</i>) spots, from which appearance was derived the
  name "<i>chrysalis</i>,"<a name="NtA11" href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
  since applied, but somewhat improperly, to the <i>pupæ</i> of <i>all</i>
  butterflies. This golden effect is produced by a brilliant white membrane
  underlying the transparent yellow outer skin of the chrysalis, and it may
  be imitated, as discovered by Lister many years ago, "by putting a small
  piece of black gall in a strong decoction of nettles; this produces a
  scum which, when left on cap-paper, will exquisitely gild it, without the
  application of the real metal."</p>

  <p>The present species is a highly elegant insect, well named the Painted
  Lady, and in France the "<i>Belle Dame</i>."</p>

  <p>The colouring of the upper surface is composed of black and very dark
  brown, with irregular markings of an orange red, tinged partially with a
  rosy hue. Near the tip of the front wings are several pure white
  spots.</p>

  <p>Beneath, the great beauty lies in the delicate pencilling of the hind
  wing with pearly greys and browns, and contrasted with this, the warm
  roseate blush and aurora tint on the upper wing.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is thorny and brown, with yellow stripes down
  the back and sides. It feeds on various <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>species of thistle, but
  sometimes also on the nettle and other plants.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is brown and grey, with silver spots.</p>

  <p>The butterfly first appears about the end of July, and is seen till
  the end of September, and occasionally in October. I took a beautiful
  fresh specimen in <i>October</i>, while strolling through a nursery
  garden at Wandsworth.</p>

  <p>Those seen in early spring are <i>hybernated</i> specimens.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this butterfly in any given locality is a matter of
  great uncertainty, though it capriciously visits, and even abounds
  occasionally in almost every place.</p>

  <p>It is a bold insect, and, though agile in its movements, not difficult
  to catch, for, if disturbed or missed at the first stroke, it returns to
  the charge quite fearlessly.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE RED ADMIRAL. (<i>Vanessa Atalanta.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>In grand simplicity and vividness of colour, the Red Admiral perhaps
  surpasses every other British butterfly, and reminds one forcibly of some
  of the gorgeous denizens of the tropics. Intense black and brilliant
  scarlet in bands and borders are the two chief elements <!-- Page 119
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span>of this
  splendour, relieved delightfully by the cool white spots at the outer and
  upper corners, and by the choice little bits of blue at the inner and
  lower angles and near the margins. The painting of the under surface
  entirely beggars description. There is, in addition to the red band, a
  good deal of blue on the upper wing, and the lower wing is covered by an
  intricate embroidery of indescribable tints&mdash;all manner of browns,
  and greys, and blacks, with golden and other hues of metals, are here
  pencilled and blended with magic effect.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which feeds on the common nettle, is thorny,
  yellowish grey in colour, with light yellow lines on each side and black
  markings.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is brownish, with gold spots.</p>

  <p>The butterfly usually comes out in August, and may be met with till
  early in October. The hybernated specimens of this are more rarely seen
  than those of any of the other common <i>Vanessas</i>.</p>

  <p>Like others of its genus, the Red Admiral is familiar, and even saucy,
  in its manners, seeming to prefer the haunts of men to the solitudes that
  other insects love, flaunting boldly before our face in gardens and
  highways, where most we meet it.</p>

  <p>It is found commonly all over the country.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE PEACOCK BUTTERFLY. (<i>Vanessa Io.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The form and markings of this species, so distinct from every other of
  our butterflies, will be seen by reference to the plate; and as to its
  colouring, I will not do it the injustice to attempt a description of its
  rich perfection, more especially as almost every reader may hope to add
  the insect to his collection during his first year's hunting, and then he
  can study its beauties for himself.</p>

  <p>The under side, however, presents a remarkable contrast to the
  splendour of the reverse, being covered with shades and streaks of
  funereal blacks and browns. This affords a strange effect when the
  insect, sitting on a flower head, alternately opens and shuts the wings
  with a fanning motion, according to its custom.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig. 6), which
  feeds gregariously upon the nettle, is black, dotted with white, and
  thorny.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is greenish, with gold spots.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i>, which is common in nearly every part of England,
  comes out in August and September, the individuals met with not
  unfrequently in the spring having hybernated.</p>

  <p>Mr. Doubleday writes thus to the <i>Zoologist</i> regarding the winter
  retreats of butterflies of this genus:&mdash;"Last <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span>winter some large
  stacks of beech faggots, which had been loosely stacked up in our forest
  (<i>Epping</i>) the preceding spring, with the dead leaves adhering to
  them, were taken down and carted away, and among these were many scores
  of <i>Io</i>, <i>Urticæ</i>, and <i>Polychloros</i>."</p>

  <p>In Scotland this is generally a very rare butterfly, but has latterly
  been abundant in Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE CAMBERWELL BEAUTY. (<i>Vanessa Antiopa.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateVIII">Plate VIII</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>Many years ago, when Camberwell was a real village, luxuriating in its
  willows, the entomologists of the day were delighted by the apparition,
  in that suburb, of this well-named "Beauty," whose name since then has
  always been associated with Camberwell&mdash;certainly not a promising
  place in the present day for a butterfly hunt, for, though it has its
  "beauties" still, they are not of the lepidopterous order, nor game for
  any net that the entomologist usually carries. Since then it has been
  found at intervals, and in very variable abundance, in a wide range of
  localities.</p>

  <p>The arrangement of colours in this butterfly is most remarkable and
  unusual, by reason of the sudden contrast between the pale whitish border
  and the velvet depth of the colours it encloses. <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

  <p>The inmost portion of all the wings is a deep rich chocolate brown,
  then comes a band of black, including a row of large blue spots, and
  succeeded by an outer border of pale yellow tint, partially dappled with
  black specks.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> feeds on the <i>willow</i> (which accounts for
  its former appearance in Camberwell). It is thorny, black, with white
  dots, and a row of large red spots down the back.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is very angular, and blackish with tawny
  spots.</p>

  <p>The butterfly comes out of the chrysalis late in the autumn, and is
  seen from August till October; but a great proportion of those observed
  in this country have survived the winter, and have been seen abroad again
  in the spring. It has been frequently seen feasting on over-ripe or
  rotten fruit, and at such times may be often surprised and captured with
  ease.</p>

  <p>No spot can be pointed out where one can <i>expect</i> to meet with
  this fine insect; but it has appeared singly at intervals in the
  following localities among others:&mdash;Scotland, Ayrshire; Durham;
  Scarborough; York; Darlington; Sheffield; Manchester; Lake District;
  Appleby; Coventry; Peterborough; Oxford; Burton-on-Trent; Norfolk;
  Lincolnshire; Suffolk; Bristol; Ely; Shrewsbury; Plymouth; Teignmouth;
  Kent; Ashford; Bromley; Tenterden; Ramsgate; various places in
  neighbourhood of London; Epping; Hampshire; Isle of Wight; Lewes;
  Worthing. <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span></p>

  <p>On the Continent this is a common butterfly, in many places being the
  most abundant of all the <i>Vanessas</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE LARGE TORTOISESHELL BUTTERFLY. (<i>Vanessa Polychloros.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The beginner often has a slight difficulty in finding a good and
  permanent distinction between this species and the next (<i>V.
  Urticæ</i>). At the first blush, the superior size of this seems to be a
  sufficient mark, and then the orange of the wings has usually a much
  browner, or more tawny hue, than that of <i>Urticæ</i>; but as I have
  seen specimens of <i>Polychloros absolutely smaller</i> than some very
  large <i>Urticæ's</i>, and as the colour of both occasionally varies, so
  that they approach each other in this respect also, it is evident we must
  look for some better mark of distinction; and here <i>is</i> one. In
  <i>Polychloros</i>, <i>all</i> the light markings between the black spots
  on the upper edge of the front wing are <i>yellow</i>, whereas in
  <i>Urticæ</i> the <i>outer one next the blue and black border is pure
  pearly</i> <span class="scac">WHITE</span>. The two other marks on the
  front edge are yellow. <i>Polychloros</i> has also, near the <i>lower
  corner of the front wing, an extra black spot</i>, not found in
  <i>Urticæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The blue spots on the border are in this species almost confined to
  the hind wings. <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> generally feeds on the elm, whence the
  butterfly is occasionally called the "Elm Butterfly," but it has also
  been found on the willow, and on the white beam-tree. Mr. Boscher of
  Twickenham informs me that the specimens he has bred from caterpillars
  fed on the <i>willow</i> have been all far below the average size. The
  caterpillar is thorny, and of a tawny colour, broadly striped with black
  along each side.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is of a dull flesh colour, with golden spots.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> makes its appearance in July and August,
  <i>hybernated</i> specimens being also frequently seen in the spring,
  from March till May.</p>

  <p>In some places and seasons it is not rare, but is very uncertain in
  its appearance, abounding most in the southern districts, and being
  almost unknown in Scotland. It is fond of gardens and other frequented
  places.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SMALL TORTOISESHELL BUTTERFLY. (<i>Vanessa Urticæ.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>This pretty species is much commoner than the last, being, in fact,
  the most plentiful of all the <i>genus</i>, and found everywhere, in
  gardens, by weedy road-sides and waste grounds, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Its markings are very similar to those of the last, but the colouring
  is much more gay and brilliant. <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span></p>

  <p>The distinguishing mark of this species&mdash;the possession of a pure
  <i>white</i> spot near the upper corner of the front wing&mdash;has been
  already pointed out under <i>V. Polychloros</i>.</p>

  <p>The blue crescent-spots of the border are much more marked than in the
  last, and extend along the edge of the front wing. The orange colour also
  approaches a <i>scarlet</i>, and the yellow spots have a brighter hue
  than in <i>Polychloros</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which is found feeding in large companies on
  the nettle, is of greyish colour, with a black line on the back, and
  brown and yellow stripes on the sides. Thorny, like rest of the
  genus.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is generally of a brown hue, spotted with gold,
  but I have seen it gilded all over, making a very splendid
  appearance.</p>

  <p>Hybernated individuals of this butterfly are seen during the spring
  months, but the first emergence from the chrysalis takes place in June,
  and the insect is seen on the wing constantly from that time till
  October.</p>

  <p>The following interesting notice of the capture of a swarm of these
  butterflies in <i>mid-winter</i>, is quoted, from the <i>Zoologist</i>,
  p. 5000. The writer is a Mr. Banning, resident near Ballacraine, in the
  Isle of Man:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Whilst standing in my farm-yard on the day following Christmas-day
  (1855), it being unusually fine and warm, I was suddenly astonished by
  the fall of <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>more than a hundred of the accompanying
  butterflies (<i>V. Urticæ</i>). I commenced at once collecting them, and
  succeeded in securing more than sixty. These I have fed on sugar spread
  over cabbage-leaves and bran until now, and, to all appearances, those
  which still survive (more than forty in number) are thriving well, and in
  good condition."</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE COMMA BUTTERFLY. (<i>Grapta C. Album.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>The singularly jagged outline of this butterfly at once distinguishes
  it from every other native species, though, did we not know it as a
  distinct species, it might have been taken for one of the two previous
  species very much stunted, deformed, and torn, so similar is it in colour
  and the plan of its markings.</p>

  <p>The upper surface is deep fulvous, or rusty orange, and marked with
  black and dark brown. In different individuals, the under side varies
  greatly in its tints and markings, especially near the border of the
  wings, which are sometimes of a deep rich olive brown, sometimes pale
  tawny. They all agree, however, in bearing in the centre of the hind
  wings the character from which the insect takes its specific name, viz. a
  white mark in form of the letter C, which has also been likened with less
  justice to a <b>,</b> whence its English name of "Comma." <!-- Page 127
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span></p>

  <p>The female is of a paler tint than the male, and the edges of the
  wings are less deeply scalloped and cut. The figure is that of a
  male.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is tawny-coloured; but the back, for about the
  hinder half its length, is whitish; head black. The body is armed with
  short spines, and there are two ear-like tubercles projecting from the
  side of the head. It has been found feeding on the elm, willow, sloe,
  currant, nettle, and hop.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is of the curious shape shown at fig. 24, <a
  href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.; of a brownish tint, with gold spots.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July and August, and hybernated
  individuals in the spring, up till May. Its range seems to be nearly
  confined to the Midland and Western districts. It was formerly found near
  London, and in other places, whence it has now disappeared.</p>

  <p>The following localities are given for it:&mdash;Carlisle and the Lake
  district, York, Green Hammerton (Yorkshire), Doncaster, Broomsgrove
  (Worcestershire), Warwickshire, Peterborough, Scarborough, Barnwell Wold
  (Northamptonshire), Bristol, Gloucester, Dorchester. I found it very
  plentiful on the banks of the Wye, in 1858; and in the following May I
  took one in South Wales, at Pont-y-Pridd. In Scotland, Fifeshire has been
  mentioned as a locality.</p>

  <p>This is a rapid flyer, and not very easily caught when fresh on the
  wing.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SILVER-WASHED FRITILLARY (<i>Argynnis Paphia.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateIX">Plate IX</a>. fig. 4, Male; 4 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>The beautiful genus to which this butterfly belongs is distinguished
  by the adornment of silvery spots and streaks with which the under side
  of the hind wings is bedight; while the upper surface is chequered with
  black, upon a rich golden-brown ground, the device reminding one of those
  old-fashioned chequered flowers called "fritillaries," whence the common
  name of these butterflies.</p>

  <p>Of all the British Fritillaries, this is, perhaps, the loveliest, from
  the exquisite softness and harmony of the silvery pencillings on the
  iridescent green of the under side; though some of the others with bright
  silver <i>spots</i> are gayer and more sparkling.</p>

  <p>The two sexes differ considerably on the upper surface; the
  <i>male</i> being marked with black (as in the engraving) upon a bright
  orange-brown ground, while the <i>female</i> is without the broad black
  borders to the veins of the front wings, and the ground colour is
  suffused with an olive-brown tint, inclining sometimes to green. The
  black spots are also larger. Beneath, however, both sexes are marked
  nearly alike with <i>washy streaks of silver</i>, and not with defined
  spots. <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> (fig. 7, <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.), as
  with all the Fritillaries, is thorny, with two spines behind the head
  longer than the rest; black, with yellow lines along the back and sides.
  It feeds on violet leaves, also on the wild raspberry and nettle.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> (fig. 16, <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.) is
  greyish, with the tubercles silvered or gilt.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is out in July and August, and is not rare in the
  woods of the South and Midland districts, but it also extends its range
  into Scotland. On the banks of Wye, about Tintern and Monmouth, I found
  it extremely abundant. It has been seen swarming in a teasel-field, near
  Selby, Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>This is a handsomely-marked insect&mdash;orange-brown, chequered with
  black, above. Beneath, the <i>front wing</i> is coloured nearly as above,
  <i>but bears near the tip several silvery spots</i>. The hind wing is
  splendidly studded with rounded spots of silver, on a ground partly
  tawny, partly olive-green and brown. The <i>male</i> is the sex <!-- Page
  130 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  above, both as to the ground colour and markings.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which feeds on the dog-violet, is very similar
  to that of the last; as also is the <i>chrysalis</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is out in July and part of August, and may be
  seen in a variety of situations, from the breezy tops of heathy downs, to
  close-grown forest-lands in the valleys; and it seems to be distributed

  <p>On the upper surface, this insect so closely resembles the last, that
  it is difficult in a description to discriminate between them; but
  <i>beneath</i>, the two are distinguished by the <i>absence in Adippe of
  the silvery spots near the tip of the front wing</i>; and though there is
  some similarity in the arrangement of the silver spots on the hind wing,
  and in its general colouring, <i>Adippe</i> is distinguished by a row of
  rust-red spots, with small silvery centres, between the silver border
  spots and the next row inwards. By comparing the figures of the under
  sides of <i>Adippe</i> and <i>Aglaia</i>, these will be readily made out.
  <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is thorny, greyish, with black spots on the
  back, intersected by a white line. Feeds on the violet.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is reddish, spotted with silver.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July, in many open places, in woods,
  and on heaths, in various parts of England, but most plentifully in the
  south. Like the last species, it is an active and wary insect on the
  wing, and requires considerable agility and dexterity for its
  capture.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE QUEEN OF SPAIN FRITILLARY. (<i>Argynnis Lathonia.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>This splendid little species is one of the prize-flies of the
  collector&mdash;that is, if the specimen be an undoubted native; for
  while a "Queen of Spain" taken within our shores will command a
  considerable sum of money in the market, another, precisely similar, but
  brought over from the opposite French coast, may be bought for a very few
  pence; but the mode of carriage, you see, makes all the difference, and
  the value of the insect depends entirely upon whether its own wings or a
  steam-boat have brought it over the Channel. So much for "the fancy."</p>

  <p>When figured side by side with the other Fritillaries, this species
  looks distinct enough from any of them; <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>but it has been several
  times confounded with small specimens of <i>Adippe</i> and with
  <i>Euphrosyne</i>, and its capture has thereupon been erroneously
  published; but this must have been the effect of a description
  imperfectly written or read. It will be observed that the form of the
  front wings differs in this from the rest of the Fritillaries, the outer
  margin being <i>concave</i> in its outline. The inner corner of the hind
  wings also is more sharply angular.</p>

  <p>Above, the colouring of the wings is similar to that of the others of
  the genus, tawny-brown and black. Beneath, the front wing has a group of
  silver spots near the tip, the ground colour of the hind wing is
  yellowish, and the silver spots are proportionately larger than in the
  other species; <i>near the margin of the hind wing</i>, and parallel with
  its edge, are <i>seven dark-brown spots with silver centres</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is brown, striped with white, and yellowish
  tint; head, legs, and thorns, tawny coloured. It feeds on the wild
  heartsease, also on sainfoin and borage.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is tinted with dull-green and brown, and spotted
  with gold.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is said to be double-brooded&mdash;one brood
  appearing in June, the other in September. The most likely places in
  which to look for it are clover fields in the south of England, and more
  especially on the south-east coast. Though still classed among the rarest
  of British butterflies, it has been found in a great many localities. It
  has been taken at Brighton; Shoreham; Eastbourne; Dover; Margate;
  Ashford; Chatham; Exeter; Bristol; Harleston, near Norwich; Colchester;
  Lavenham; Peterborough.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE PEARL-BORDERED FRITILLARY. (<i>Argynnis Euphrosyne.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateX">Plate X</a>. fig. 4.)</p>

  <p>This very common insect is considerably smaller than any of the
  preceding species, though small specimens of the last sometimes do not
  much exceed it in size. The upper surface is lively orange-brown, with
  black markings. Beneath, the <i>hind wing</i> is mapped out with black
  lines into various irregular spaces, <i>all</i> of which are filled with
  tints of dull yellow, ochreous, or reddish orange; excepting a row of
  silver spots on the border, <i>one silver spot in the centre of the
  wing</i>, and <i>one</i> triangular one close to the root of the
  wing.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is black, with white lines; and the pro-legs
  red. It feeds on various species of <i>viola</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears first in May, and there is another brood
  in autumn, about August. It frequents woods and hedgerows, being met with
  most profusely in the south; but its range is extended into Scotland. In
  Ireland I believe it is unknown.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SMALL PEARL-BORDERED FRITILLARY. (<i>Argynnis Selene.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>This butterfly, which is very nearly related to the last, often so
  closely resembles it in the marking of the upper surface, that even
  practised eyes are sometimes at a loss to distinguish the two, without a
  reference to the under side; for on this side do the real distinctive
  marks lie, and chiefly on the hind wing. In addition to the silver border
  and central spots of <i>Euphrosyne</i>, this species has several other
  silvery or pearly patches distributed over the hind wing; and the
  reddish-orange colour adjoining the silver border in <i>Euphrosyne</i> is
  exchanged for dark chestnut-brown in <i>Selene</i>. In average size the
  two insects differ very slightly, though the name of this expresses an
  inferior size.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> much resembles that of the last, and feeds on
  violet-leaves.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is greyish.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is double-brooded, appearing first in May and
  again in August. It is not so common an insect as <i>Euphrosyne</i>, but
  is met with in similar situations, and has a range nearly co-extensive
  with that of the latter.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE GLANVILLE FRITILLARY. (<i>Melitæa Cinxia.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>Though usually rather abundant where it occurs at all, this insect is
  one of the most local of all our butterflies, and I can only find
  recorded about a dozen places for it in the country. Of these, the Isle
  of Wight is the great metropolis of the insect, and there, in many places
  round the coast, numerous colonies have been established.</p>

  <p>This butterfly is distinguished from the next (<i>M. Athalia</i>),
  which it very much resembles, principally by the characters on the under
  surface.</p>

  <p>The hind wing (beneath) is covered with alternate bands of bright
  straw-colour and orange-brown, divided by black lines; and possesses in
  <i>the marginal straw-coloured band a row of clear</i> <span
  class="scac">BLACK SPOTS</span>. Another row of black spots crosses the
  centre of the wing. It will also be observed that the <i>hind wings</i>
  have on <i>their upper surface a row of black spots</i> parallel with,
  and not far from, the margin. The colouring of the upper side is
  orange-brown with black markings.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which feeds on the narrow-leaved plantain, is
  thorny and black, with reddish head and legs. The chrysalis is brownish,
  marked with fulvous tint. A highly interesting account of the habits and
  <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>{136}</span>history of this butterfly in all its
  stages has been sketched from the life by the Rev. J. F. Dawson (who has
  made an intimate acquaintance with a colony of the insect at Sandown,
  Isle of Wight), and will be found in the <i>Zoologist</i>, p. 1271.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> first appears about the first or second week in
  May, and thence continues till about the middle of June, seldom enduring
  till July. It is to be looked for in rough, broken ground, such as the
  Isle of Wight landslips, where plenty of the narrow-leaved plantain
  grows.</p>

  <p>Other localities for the Glanville Fritillary are, Folkestone below
  West-Cliff (abundant); round Dover; Birchwood; Dartford, Kent;
  Stapleford, near Cambridge; Yorkshire; Lincolnshire; Wiltshire;
  Peterboro', Stowmarket; and in Scotland, at Falkland in Fifeshire.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE PEARL-BORDERED LIKENESS FRITILLARY. (<i>Melitæa Athalia.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>This is another very local butterfly, though rather more widely and
  generally distributed than the last, which, as before stated, it greatly
  resembles in appearance, especially on the upper side. <!-- Page 137
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p>It may be characterised negatively as <i>not</i> having the rows of
  black spots found on both surfaces of <i>Cinxia</i>, though its colouring
  is very similar&mdash;fulvous (or orange-brown) and black above;
  straw-coloured, fulvous, and black beneath.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is black, with rust-coloured spines; and feeds
  on various species of plantain.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is out from May to July, and is met with (if at
  all) on heaths, clearings in woods, &amp;c. Localities, in some of which
  it is very plentiful, are, Caen Wood; Coombe Wood; Epping; Halton, Bucks;
  Bedford; Aspley Wood, Beds; Plymouth, Teignmouth, Stowmarket, Dartmoor,
  Devonshire; Oxford; Wiltshire; Colchester; St. Osyth; Tenterden;
  Faversham; Deal; Canterbury. Very rare in north of England.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE GREASY OR MARSH FRITILLARY. (<i>Melitæa Artemis.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>. fig. 4.)</p>

  <p>The <i>black</i> markings on the upper side of this butterfly closely
  approach those of the last two species, but the interstices, instead of
  being filled up with a <i>uniform fulvous tint</i>, as in those, are
  "coloured in" with <i>several distinct shades</i>, some with <i>pale
  tawny yellow</i>, others with <i>deep orange brown</i>. This latter tint
  forms a band parallel <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>{138}</span>to the outer margin of each wing, the band
  on the front wings having a row of pale spots in it; that on the hind
  wings a row of black spots. <i>Beneath</i>, the upper wing has an
  appearance of the markings having been "smudged" together, and a shining
  surface, as if it had been greased, whence the common name of the insect;
  the hinder wings are like those of the two last, yellowish, banded with
  brownish orange, the outer band of which bears a <i>series of black spots
  each surrounded by a pale yellowish ring</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>front</i> edge of the front wing is slightly <i>concave</i> in
  its outline, about the middle, whereas it is <i>convex</i> in
  <i>Cinxia</i> and <i>Athalia</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is black, with reddish brown legs. It is
  gregarious, feeding under protection of a web upon the leaves of
  plantain, devils-bit scabious, and some other plants.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is drabbish, with darker spots, and is said to
  suspend itself by the tail from the top of a tent-like structure made of
  blades of grass spun together at the top.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in June (sometimes a little earlier or
  later), and frequents marshy meadows, moist woods, &amp;c., but is a very
  local insect, abounding most in the south. The specimens, however, that I
  have seen from the north, are much larger, brighter, and more distinctly
  marked than the "southerners." The nearest localities to London are,
  Hornsey, and Copthall Wood at the top of Muswell Hill; West Wickham Wood,
  and <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>High-Beech (Epping). It is also found near
  Brighton (plentifully); Carlisle; Durham; Burton-on-Trent; York;
  Haverfordwest, S. W.; Cardiff, S. W.; Weston-super-Mare; Bristol; and a
  great number of other places distributed throughout the country. In
  Ireland at Ardrahan, co. Galway. Rare in Scotland.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXI">Plate XI</a>. fig. 5.)</p>

  <p>Though this little insect bears the name of <i>Fritillary</i>, at the
  end of its lengthy and important title, it really belongs to a family
  widely differing from that of any of the true Fritillaries previously
  described, and it only shared their name on account of its similarity in
  colour and markings.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig. 8),
  instead of being long and thorny like those of the true Fritillaries, is
  <i>short, thick, and wood-louse shaped</i>. Its colour is reddish brown,
  with tufts of hair of the same colour. It feeds on the primrose.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> differs from that of the true Fritillaries as
  much as the caterpillar does, being of the form, and suspended in the
  manner, shown at fig. 25, <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is chequered on the upper surface with <!-- Page
  140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>tawny, and
  dark brown or black. It appears in May and June, and again in August,
  being found in woods, principally in the south, and its range is often
  confined to a small spot hardly fifty yards in diameter, within which it
  may be quite plentiful. The following are among its recorded
  localities:&mdash;Carlisle; Lake District; West Yorkshire; Roche Abbey,
  Yorkshire; Peterborough; Stowmarket; Pembury; Barnwell Wold, Northants;
  Oxford; Blandford; Worcester; Gloucestershire; Bedfordshire; Epping;
  Coombe Wood; Darenth Wood; Boxhill; Dorking; Brighton; Lewes; Worthing;

  butterfly belongs, and of which this is the sole European
  representative&mdash;<i>the</i> <span

<p class="cenhead">THE BROWN HAIR-STREAK. (<i>Thecla Betulæ.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>. fig. 1, Male; 1 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>The genus to which this butterfly belongs, contains five British
  species, elegant and interesting insects, though not gaily tinted. They
  are most obviously distinguished from other small butterflies by the
  <i>tail-like</i> projection on the lower edge of their hind wings (though
  one of their <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>{141}</span>number, <i>T. Rubi</i>, has this very
  slightly developed). From each other they are best distinguished by the
  characters on their under surface, where they all bear a more or less
  distinct <i>hair</i>-like <i>streak</i>, whence their common
  name&mdash;Hair-streak.</p>

  <p>The Brown Hair-streak is the largest of the genus, measuring sometimes
  an inch and two-thirds in expanse. The two sexes differ considerably on
  the upper surface, the male being of a deep brown colour, slightly paler
  near the middle of the front wing, while the female possesses on the
  front wing a <i>large patch of clear orange</i>. Both sexes have several
  orange marks upon the lower angles of the hind wings. Beneath, the
  general colour is tawny orange with duller bands, and marked with one
  white line on the front wing, and <i>two parallel white lines on the hind
  wings</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, marked obliquely with white; it feeds
  on the birch and also on the sloe.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in August, continuing into September. It
  is generally distributed through the south, but is by no means an
  abundant insect. Mr. Stainton observes that it has a habit of "flitting
  along in hedges just in advance of the collector;" but it is also found
  in oak woods in company with the Purple Hair-streak.</p>

  <p>Forty were taken in a season in woods near Henfield, Sussex. Other
  localities are, Underbarrow Moss, Westmoreland; North Lancashire, common
  in some parts; Preston; Valley of the Dovey, Montgomeryshire; <!-- Page

<p class="cenhead">THE BLACK HAIR-STREAK. (<i>Thecla Pruni.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The upper side is very dark brown, sometimes almost black, and bearing
  near the <i>hinder</i> edge of the <i>hind wings</i> a <i>few orange
  spots</i>. This character will at once distinguish this from the next
  species (<i>W. Album</i>). On the under side of the hind wing is a
  <i>broad band of orange</i>, having a <i>row of black spots on its inner
  edge</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, with four rows of yellow spots. It
  feeds on the sloe.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> comes out about the end of June or in July. It is
  generally a very rare insect, but is occasionally taken in great plenty
  in certain spots. The Rev. W. Bree, writing to the <i>Zoologist</i> from
  the neighbourhood of Polebrook, North Hants, says, "<i>Thecla Pruni</i>
  is very uncertain in its appearance. In 1837 it literally swarmed in
  Barnwell and Ashton Wolds; I do not scruple to say that it would have
  been possible <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>to capture some hundreds of them, had one
  been so disposed; for the last few years it has appeared very sparingly
  indeed." It has also been found in the following
  localities:&mdash;Overton Wood; Brington, Huntingdonshire; and Monks
  Wood, Cambridgeshire.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead">THE WHITE LETTER HAIR-STREAK. (<i>Thecla W. Album.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXII">Plate XII</a>. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>This is very much like the last in appearance, and has often been
  mistaken for it by inexperienced eyes. The <i>points</i> of difference
  are&mdash;on the upper side, the absence of the orange band at the hinder
  edge of the hind wings, and the presence of a <i>bluish grey circumflex
  line at the inner angle</i>; here also is sometimes a <i>small orange
  dot</i>;&mdash;beneath, the <i>orange band forms a series of arches</i>,
  bounded on the edge nearest the root of the wing <i>by a clear black
  line</i> instead of the rounded black spots seen at this part in
  <i>Pruni</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which feeds on the elm, is wood-louse shaped;
  pea-green, barred with yellow; head black. May be beaten off elm trees in
  May.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July, and is found in various
  situations, sometimes flying high up round elm trees, sometimes
  descending to bramble hedges, or fluttering <!-- Page 144 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>about in weedy fields a
  foot or two from the ground. It was formerly a much rarer insect than at
  present, and now its appearance in any given locality is a matter of much
  uncertainty. Mr. J. F. Stephens writes as follows to the
  <i>Zoologist</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"For eighteen years I possessed four bleached specimens only of
  <i>Thecla W. Album</i>, having vainly endeavoured to procure others,
  when, in 1827, as elsewhere recorded, I saw the insect at Ripley, not by
  dozens only, but by scores of thousands! and although I frequented the
  same locality for thirteen years subsequently, sometimes in the season
  for a month together, I have not since seen a single specimen there; but
  in 1833 I caught one specimen at Madingley Wood, near Cambridge."</p>

  <p>Other localities:&mdash;Near Sheffield; Roche Abbey; York;
  Peterborough; near Doncaster; Polebrook, Northants; Allesley,

  <p>At once the commonest and the handsomest of the Hair-streaks, being
  found in almost every part of England where there is an oak wood, and
  looking like a small Purple Emperor, with its rich gloss of the imperial
  colour.</p>

  <p>The <i>male</i> has all the wings, in certain lights, of a dark brown
  colour, but with a change of position they become illuminated with a deep
  rich purple tint, extending over the whole surface excepting a narrow
  border, which then appears black. The <i>female</i> has the purple much
  more vivid, but confined to a <i>small patch</i> extending from the root
  to the centre of the front wing. Beneath, the wings are shaded with
  greyish tints, crossed by a white line on each wing, and having <i>two
  orange spots</i> at the inner corner of the hind wing.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig. 9), which
  feeds on the oak, is reddish brown, marked with black.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i>, which is sometimes attached to the leaves of the
  oak, and at others is found <i>under the surface of the earth</i> at the
  foot of the tree, is a brownish object, of the lumpy shape shown in <a

  all the Hair-streaks). <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is seen in July and August, flitting about in
  sportive groups round oak trees, and occasionally descending within reach
  of the net. It also affects other trees besides oaks, some thirty or
  forty at a time having been seen gambolling about one <i>lime</i> tree.
  It being so generally distributed, it will be needless to particularize
  its localities.</p>

  butterflies by the rich <i>bright green</i> colour that overspreads its
  under surface. Above, the wings are deep, warm brown.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, spotted and striped with white, and
  feeds on the bramble; also on the broom, and other plants of the same
  order.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears first in May and June, and again in
  August, it being <i>double-brooded</i>. It is found flying about rough
  brambly hedges, and often settles on the outer leaves of low trees about
  a dozen feet from the ground. It seems to occur generally throughout the
  country, and extends into the southern parts of Scotland. It has been

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>We now arrive at a genus characterized by the splendid golden or
  burnished coppery lustre and tint of their wings; of which, however, the
  present little species is the only one that remains to us, should the
  "<i>Large Copper</i>" be really (as it is feared) extinct.</p>

  <p>This little, but lively representative of the genus, is one of our
  commonest and most widely distributed butterflies, flashing about in the
  sunshine, joining in a dance with the no less lively blues, or settling
  on the lilac flowers of the scabious, &amp;c., whose soft tones set off

<p class="cenhead">THE LARGE COPPER BUTTERFLY. (<i>Chrysophanus Dispar.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>. fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>A few years ago, this was the pride of British entomology, for we were
  supposed to have the insect entirely to ourselves, it being unknown on
  the Continent, whilst it literally swarmed in some of the fens of
  Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Then, from some cause, never
  satisfactorily explained, it almost suddenly disappeared, and, there is
  reason to fear, has become quite extinct in this country. Still, hopes
  are entertained that it may be surviving in some unexplored districts,
  and that it will again "turn up."</p>

  <p>As comparatively very few persons have ever seen this splendid
  creature on the wing, the following communication from one who
  <i>has</i>, quoted from the <i>Intelligencer</i>, will be of interest to
  those who have not read it in that periodical. It is from the pen of Mr.
  E. C. F. Jenkins, of Sleaford, Lincolnshire. He writes: "I proceed to
  give you some account of my own acquaintance with that most beautiful
  insect, which, some thirty years ago, was so abundant in the unreclaimed
  fens about Whittlesea Mere, that I never expected to hear of its utter
  extermination. Its brilliant appearance on the wing in the sunshine I
  shall never forget, and to watch it sitting on <!-- Page 149 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>the flower of the
  <i>Eupatorium cannabinum</i> and show the under sides of its wings, was
  something ever to be remembered. I once took sixteen in about half an
  hour on one particular spot, where the above-mentioned plant was very
  plentiful; but unless the sun was very bright they were very difficult to
  find. In those days the larva was unknown, and I attribute the
  disappearance of the butterfly to the discovery of the larva, to the
  unceasing attacks of collectors, and to the burning of the surface-growth
  of the fens, which is done in dry weather when they are to be
  reclaimed."</p>

  <p>The two sexes of this butterfly differ very remarkably in the
  appearance of the upper surface. This, in the <i>male</i>, is of an
  effulgent coppery colour, narrowly bordered with black, and having a
  black mark in the centre of each wing. The <i>female</i> is larger, has a
  redder tinge, with a row of black spots on the front wings, and the hind
  wings nearly covered with black, excepting a band of coppery red near the
  margin, extending also more or less distinctly along the courses of the
  veins. Underneath, both sexes are nearly alike, the hind wing of a
  general <i>light blue tint</i>, with a red band near the margin, and
  spotted with black.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, darker on the back, and paler at the
  sides, it feeds on the water dock.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> used to be found in July and August, being
  formerly especially abundant about Yaxley and Whittlesea Mere, and has
  been taken also at Benacre, Suffolk; and Bardolph Fen, Norfolk. <!-- Page
  150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>{150}</span></p>

  <p>Various reports of its capture, during the last two or three years,
  have been published; but they all seem to require confirmation.</p>

  <p>This butterfly is now generally considered to be a <i>large</i> local
  variety of the continental one called <i>Hippothoë</i>, with which it
  closely agrees in its markings.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE BLUES. (Genus <i>Polyommatus</i>.)</p>

  <p>We now arrive at a numerous genus of elegant and lively little
  insects, collectively known as the "Blues," though some of them are
  <i>not blue</i> at all. In their manners, and the localities they
  inhabit, there is so much in common, that one description of these will
  answer for nearly every one of them; so that my small available space
  will be in great part devoted to pointing out the marks of distinction
  between the various species, ten in number, several of them closely
  resembling others in general appearance, and requiring some care in their
  discrimination.</p>

  <p>Their <i>caterpillars</i>, which are wood-louse shaped, or
  <i>onisciform</i>, generally feed on low plants, chiefly of the
  papilionaceous order; and the <i>butterflies</i> are found in dry
  meadows, on downs, and in open heathy places. The first species, <i>P.
  Argiolus</i>, is, however, an exception to the above, both in its food
  and haunts. <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span></p>

  <p>Several species of this genus are often found together. For example,
  in the Isle of Wight, last August, I took <i>P. Argiolus</i>,
  <i>Corydon</i>, <i>Adonis</i>, <i>Alexis</i>, and <i>Agestis</i>, all
  within about one hour, and a space of a few yards square in the corner of
  a field.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE AZURE BLUE BUTTERFLY. (<i>Polyommatus Argiolus.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>. fig. 3, Male; 3 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, beautiful lilac blue&mdash;the
  male with a narrow black border (fig. 3), the female with a broad one,
  sometimes extending over the outer half of the wing (fig. 3 a). Under
  side, very delicate <i>silvery blue, almost white</i>, with numerous
  small black spots. <i>No red spots.</i></p>

  <p><i>Caterpillar</i>, green, with darker line on back. Feeds on the
  flowers of holly, ivy, and buckthorn.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in May, or sometimes in April, and again
  in August, frequenting <i>woods</i> and hedges, especially where holly
  and ivy abound. I noticed immense numbers about the ivied walls of
  Chepstow Castle.</p>

  <p>As the name "Azure Blue" is in general use, I have retained it above,
  but that of "Holly Blue," sometimes <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>applied to it, is
  preferable, as its colour is much less an azure blue than that of
  <i>Adonis</i>.</p>

  <p>Localities:&mdash;Common in the south, and found as far north as
  Durham and the Lake District. Not known in Scotland.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE BEDFORD BLUE, OR LITTLE BLUE. (<i>Polyommatus Alsus.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>. fig. 4, Male; 4 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>This is the <i>smallest of British butterflies</i>, specimens being
  sometimes seen even smaller than those figured.</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, dark brown, distinctly powdered
  with blue near the root of the wing in the <i>male, without blue in the
  female</i>. Under side, <i>pale grey-drab</i>, bluish near the base,
  marked with rows of <i>black spots</i> in pale rings. <i>No red
  spots.</i></p>

  <p><i>Caterpillar</i>, green, orange stripe down back, and streaks of
  same colour on each side.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is out in May and June, and is sometimes seen
  much later. It is generally met with on limestone or chalky soils; and,
  from a long list of localities I have looked over, it seems to be
  distributed over England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIII">Plate XIII</a>. fig. 5, Male; 5 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, male, <i>deep purple, or mazarine
  blue</i>, with a <i>border of black</i> (fig. 5); female, <i>dark
  brown</i> (fig. 5 <i>a</i>). Under sides of both sexes similar, <i>pale
  greyish drab</i>, tinged at the base with greenish blue, numerous
  <i>black spots in white rings</i>. No red spots.</p>

  <p>Though this elegant butterfly was frequently met with some years ago,
  it has lately become one of our rarest species, and I can give no
  locality where it can be now found. It has been <i>reported</i> as taken
  lately at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, and somewhere in South Wales, also in
  other places, but only singly.</p>

  <p>Collectors, on visiting any new district, should net all the Blues
  they are not <i>quite</i> sure are common ones, and this may perchance
  turn up among them sometimes.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is said to feed on the flower heads of common
  Thrift (<i>Armeria vulgaris</i>).</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> may be <i>looked for</i> in July.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>. fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>This is the <i>largest</i> of all our "Blues," and, next to the last,
  the rarest, though still taken in some numbers every year.</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, <i>dark blue</i>, granulated with
  black scales that give it a dull aspect, having a black border, and a
  series of <i>large black spots across the front wing</i>. Under side,
  greyish drab, suffused with greenish blue near the body; towards centre,
  many black spots in indistinct light-coloured rings, and a double border
  of the same. <i>No red spots.</i></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is <i>unknown</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July, frequenting rough, flowery
  pasture-grounds, but is exceedingly local. A famous place for it is
  Barnwell Wold, about a mile and a half from the village of Barnwell, near
  Oundle, Northamptonshire, where the insect was discovered by the Rev. W.
  Bree many years ago; but it is less abundant there than formerly, from
  the repeated attacks of collectors, who catch all they can find. Other
  localities, mentioned in various works, are&mdash;Brington,
  Huntingdonshire; Shortwood, and some other spots, near Cheltenham;
  Charmouth, Dorsetshire; Dover; Downs <!-- Page 155 --><span

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>. fig. 2, Male; 2 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, <i>male, pale silvery greenish
  blue</i>, with very silky gloss, and shading off into a <i>broad black
  border</i>.</p>

  <p>Female, dark smoky brown, with a leaden tinge, sprinkled near the body
  with <i>greenish</i> blue scales of the <i>same colour</i> as the males;
  border of orange spots, more or less visible. <i>Under side</i> marked as
  in fig. 2 <i>a</i>, on a brown ground, with a row of <i>red</i> spots
  near border of hind wing.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> (<a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>. fig. 10) is
  green, striped with yellow on the back and sides.</p>

  <p>The <i>chrysalis</i> is brownish, and of the shape shown at fig. 29,
  <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is out in July and August, frequenting chalky
  downs, especially in the south, and where it does occur is often
  extremely abundant. Occasionally it is found <i>off the chalk</i>, having
  been seen in Epping Forest, decidedly <i>not</i> a chalk district. Other
  localities <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page156"></a>{156}</span>are&mdash;Croydon; Brighton; Lewes; Dover;
  Winchester; Isle of Wight; Halton, Bucks; Newmarket; Peterborough;
  Norfolk; Suffolk; Berkshire; Oxfordshire; Wiltshire; Gloucestershire. At
  Grange, North Lancashire, it is the commonest "Blue," <i>not on
  chalk</i>, but <i>limestone</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE ADONIS BLUE. (<i>Polyommatus Adonis.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>. fig. 3, Male; 3 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, <i>male, brilliant sky-blue,
  without any lilac tinge</i>, bordered by a distinct black line, the
  <i>fringe distinctly barred with blackish</i>. Female, dark smoky brown,
  sprinkled near body with <i>pure blue scales the colour of those of
  male</i>; border of orange spots, more or less visible.</p>

  <p>Under side, male, marked as in fig. 3; border of red spots.</p>

  <p>Female, almost exactly like that of Corydon (fig. 2 <i>a</i>), but
  usually has the black spots on the front wing smaller.</p>

  <p>This is a most lovely little butterfly, the blue of its upper surface
  being quite unapproachable among native insects. Mr. Stainton, speaking
  of the different blues of Corydon and Adonis, happily observes that,
  "<i>Corydon</i> <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>{157}</span>reminds one of the soft silvery appearance
  of <i>moonlight</i>, whilst <i>Adonis</i> recalls the intense blue of the
  sky on a hot summer's day."</p>

  <p><i>Caterpillar</i> like that of Corydon.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is double-brooded, appearing first in May and
  again in August. It is found on the same soils and in most of the
  localities with the last, but is, I believe, more confined to the
  south.</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, male, lilac blue. Female, purplish
  blue about the centre, brown towards the margins, but the proportions of
  blue and brown are very variable&mdash;sometimes all the wings have a
  border of orange-red spots, sometimes these are absent from one or both
  pairs of wings.</p>

  <p><i>Fringe</i> in both sexes <i>white, uninterrupted by dark
  bars</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Under side</i>, male, marked as in fig. 4, and hardly to be
  distinguished from under side of male Adonis, except by the ground
  colour, which is paler and <i>greyer</i> than in Adonis. Female, same
  pattern as male, but coloured with warmer tints&mdash;more like male
  Adonis. <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span></p>

  <p>This very pretty little insect is the blue butterfly one sees
  everywhere, abounding in meadows, on heaths and downs, and not at all
  confined to chalky soils, like some other "blues."</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, with darker stripe on the back, and
  white spots on each side. It feeds on Bird's-foot Trefoil and other
  leguminous plants.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is to be found almost constantly from the end of
  May to the end of September, being double-brooded.</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>. fig. 5, male; 5 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>:&mdash;Upper side, <i>male, purplish blue</i> (rather
  deeper than that of Alexis), with a rather broad black margin. Female,
  dark brown, sometimes slightly tinged with blue, and bordered on the hind
  wings with dull orange spots; but these are often absent.</p>

  <p>Fringe white, <i>not</i> barred with black. Under side, <i>near the
  margin of the hind wings</i>, and between that and the orange border
  spots, are several <i>metallic spots, of a bluish tint</i>, whence the
  insect has its name of "Silver-studded." <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is brown, with white lines. Feeds on broom and
  other plants of the same order.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July and August, and is very
  frequently met with throughout the country on heaths, commons, and downs,
  both on sandy and chalky soils. In many places it is the commonest of the
  "Blues." It has been found at Epping; Coombe Wood; Darenth Wood; Box
  Hill; Ripley, Surrey; Brighton; Lewes; Deal; Lyndhurst; Blandford;
  Brandon, Suffolk; Holt, Norfolk; Birkenhead; Bristol; Sarum, Wiltshire;

<p class="cenhead">THE BROWN ARGUS. (<i>Polyommatus Agestis.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>. fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>Though this butterfly and the next are classed among the "Blues," from
  their possessing the same structure and habits, there is <i>no trace of
  blue</i> in the colouring of <i>either sex</i>, as in all the preceding
  species of <i>Polyommatus</i>.</p>

  <p>In this species the colour of both sexes on the upper side is a
  <i>warm, dark brown</i>, having on all the wings a border of dark orange
  spots. The female hardly differs from the male, except in having this
  border broader, and more extended on the front wing; where, <!-- Page 160
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span>in the male,
  it is sometimes very indistinct. The under side much resembles that of
  the female of <i>Alexis</i>, the border of orange spots being even more
  distinct on the front wing than on the hind one. It will be observed on
  referring to <a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>. that on the under sides
  of all the butterflies there figured, there is an irregular black spot
  situated near the front edge of the upper wing and midway in its
  length&mdash;this is called the "<i>discoidal spot</i>." It will also be
  observed that the common Blue (fig. 4) has, on the area of the wing,
  between the discoidal spot and the root of the wing, two spots, which are
  <i>absent in this species</i>. This forms a very ready mark of
  distinction, though it requires a good many words to explain it.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i>, which feeds on <i>Erodium Cicutarium</i>, and
  perhaps on <i>Helianthemum</i> (Rock Cistus), is green, with pale spots
  on the back, and a brownish line down the middle.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in May and June, and again in August, and
  is common in very many localities in the south, being particularly
  abundant on the downs of the south coast and the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE ARTAXERXES BUTTERFLY. (<i>Polyommatus Artaxerxes.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXIV">Plate XIV</a>. fig. 7.)</p>

  <p><i>Colouring</i>, same as in the last species (<i>Agestis</i>); but on
  the upper surface, the orange border-spots are often hardly perceptible
  on the front wing, and there is a distinct <i>white</i> spot in the
  centre of the front wings. The <i>under side</i> also is precisely like
  that of Agestis, with the black spots removed from the centre of the
  white rings, which are thus changed into <i>large white spots</i>, as
  shown in the figure.</p>

  <p>There has been a great deal of discussion among entomologists, as to
  whether this be a distinct <i>species</i>, or only a variety of
  <i>Agestis</i>. I believe it to be the latter, but do not attach much
  importance to the question; and as this butterfly is found under the name
  of <i>Artaxerxes</i>, in almost every cabinet, and is rather a famous
  little insect, I have thought it best to give it a separate heading under
  its usual title, and collecting readers may still label it in their
  cabinet either as above, or as "<i>P. Agestis, var. Artaxerxes</i>," and
  probably will be equally right either way.</p>

  <p>The popular nature and limited extent of this work will not, however,
  admit of the subject being entered into scientifically, and I can only
  here state that I have <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>seen specimens from various parts of the
  country, that include every intermediate variety between the ordinary
  <i>Agestis</i> of the south, and the <i>Artaxerxes</i> of Scotland. The
  Durham Argus, formerly called <i>P. Salmacis</i>, forms one of these
  gradations.</p>

  <p>Against the idea of <i>Agestis</i> and <i>Artaxerxes</i> being one
  species, it has been objected, that the former is double, the latter
  single brooded. What of that? Plenty of species that are double-brooded
  in the south of Europe are well known to become single-brooded in a more
  northern situation.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is said to be exactly like that of
  <i>Agestis</i>. It feeds on <i>Helianthemum vulgare</i> (Rock
  Cistus).</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> is found in July and August in several parts of
  Scotland, and the north of England. Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh, has been
  long noted for producing it.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SKIPPERS. (Family&mdash;<i>Hesperidæ</i>.)</p>

  <p>These curious little butterflies form a very natural group; in many
  respects, both of structure and habits, approaching the moths, and
  therefore placed at the end of the butterflies. They are of small size,
  but robust appearance, and not brightly coloured. Their flight is rapid,
  but of short continuance, and they seem to <i>skip</i> from flower to
  flower: hence their name. They are chiefly distinguished scientifically
  from other butterflies by the form of the <i>antennæ</i>, which are more
  or less hooked at the tip (see one magnified on <a href="#plateII">Plate
  II</a>. fig. 14), by the great width of the head, and the distance
  between the roots of the <i>antennæ</i>, by their moth-like habit of
  rolling up leaves for their habitation when caterpillars, and by spinning
  a <i>cocoon</i> for the chrysalis. The caterpillars are shaped as in fig.
  11, <a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>.; the chrysalides, as in figs. 26 and

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>. fig. 4, Male; 4 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>This plainly-coloured little butterfly, prized by collectors for its
  rarity, has, in the male sex, great general resemblance to that of the
  next species&mdash;the common <i>P. Linea</i>&mdash;but <i>Actæon</i> may
  be distinguished by having the wings clouded over nearly the whole
  surface with <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>dull brown, having something of a greenish
  cast. The <i>female</i> is, however, very different from that of
  <i>Linea</i>, having all the wings of uniform dingy brown, excepting a
  crescent-shaped row of tawny spots near the tip of the front wing, and a
  more or less distinct streak of the same colour near the centre.</p>

  <p>The male <i>Actæon</i> is further distinguished from the female by the
  possession of a blackish streak near the centre of his front wing.</p>

  <p><i>Beneath</i>, the wings are clouded obscurely with tawny yellow and
  a dingy brownish tint, the yellow tinge predominating in the male.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is unknown.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July and August, but is so extremely
  limited in its local range that it is only to be met with, so far as is
  known, in three spots&mdash;all on the same line of coast&mdash;viz.
  Lulworth Cove, Dorsetshire; the "Burning Cliff," about five miles nearer
  Weymouth along the coast; and at Sidmouth, Devonshire. At the present
  time I believe the "Burning Cliff" is the locality where the insect is
  found in the greatest plenty. It is to be looked for on the rough broken
  ground covered with weeds that slopes down to the shore on this
  coast.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SMALL SKIPPER. (<i>Pamphila Linea.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>. fig. 5, Male; 5 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>Upper side, <i>uniform orange tawny colour</i>, shaded into brown at
  the borders. The <i>male</i> (fig. 5) has an oblique blackish line near
  the centre of the front wing; this is absent in the female (fig. 5
  <i>a</i>). The males of this butterfly very much resemble those of the
  last rare species (<i>Actæon</i>), but they may be distinguished by the
  middle part of the upper wing not being clouded with brown, as it is in
  <i>Actæon</i>. Under side, two shades of tawny colour, but <i>not
  spotted</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green, with four white lines, and feeds on
  grasses.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July, and is very common and widely
  distributed.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE LARGE SKIPPER. (<i>Pamphila Sylvanus.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>. fig. 6, Male; 6 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>Upper side, dark rich brown, shaded and spotted with tawny or fulvous
  tint. The <i>male</i> is known by a <!-- Page 168 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>{168}</span>dark-brown,
  <i>burnt</i>-looking streak near the centre of the front wings; the
  female being without this mark. Under side, greenish, with
  <i>indistinct</i> yellowish spots.</p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is green (darker on the back), and dotted with
  black; spotted with white underneath. It feeds on various grasses.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in May, and again in August or the end of
  July; and is very common in almost every locality, frequenting grassy
  places in and near woods, road-sides, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE SILVER-SPOTTED SKIPPER. (<i>Pamphila Comma.</i>)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(<a href="#plateXV">Plate XV</a>. fig. 7, Male; 7 <i>a</i>, Female.)</p>

  <p>This butterfly closely resembles the last, especially on the upper
  side; which is, however, more brightly and clearly marked. But the chief
  distinction is to be found on the <i>under side</i>, which is marked, on
  a greenish ground, with <i>clear-cut, square white spots</i>. The male,
  as in the last species, is distinguished by the thin blackish bar placed
  obliquely on the front wing. The outline of this species also differs
  somewhat from that of the last, especially in the males. This difference
  will be better understood by comparing figs. 6 and 7 on the plate, than
  by description. <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>caterpillar</i> is dull-green and reddish, with a white collar,
  and spotted with white near the tail-end. It feeds on leguminous
  plants.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i> appears in July and August, but is only found in
  a limited number of localities, and these chiefly in the southern
  counties; but where found at all, it is generally abundant. Among its
  localities are the following:&mdash;Croydon; Brighton; Lewes; Dover;
  Lyndhurst; Blandford; Plymouth; Old Sarum, Wiltshire; Barnwell and Ashton
  Wolds, Northamptonshire; Halton, Bucks; Newmarket; Gogmagog Park,
  Cambridge; Hull; Scarborough.</p>

<h3>REPUTED BRITISH SPECIES.</h3>

  <p>On <a href="#plateXVI">Plate XVI</a>. are grouped together figures of
  six species of butterflies which are not admitted into our regular
  British lists, on account of the extreme rarity of their capture, or the
  fact of their not having been observed at all for several years past.
  They are all <i>common</i> species in various parts of the Continent, and
  some of them will probably occur again in this country.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p><span class="sc">Papilio Podalirius.</span>&mdash;The SCARCE
  SWALLOW-TAILED Butterfly (fig. 1).&mdash;There is no reasonable doubt
  that several individuals of this elegant butterfly were formerly taken in
  various parts of the country, but no captures have occurred for many
  years past. The caterpillar, also, was more than once found in the New
  Forest District, Hampshire. Generally a common insect on the
  Continent.</p>

  <p><a name="plateXVI"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/i_210.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_210.png"
      alt="XVI." title="XVI." /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Parnassius Apollo.</span>&mdash;The APOLLO Butterfly
  (fig. 2).&mdash;I have good reason for believing that a specimen of this
  splendid Alpine butterfly was captured in this country very lately, and
  it is not at all impossible that it may be some day found on our north
  country mountains, or those of the Lake District. It is a most beautiful
  insect, with its singular semi-transparent and partially <i>glazed</i>
  wings; the lower of which bear large eye-spots of crimson-scarlet.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p><span class="sc">Erebia Ligea.</span>&mdash;The ARRAN BROWN Butterfly
  (fig. 3).&mdash;Of this species, greatly resembling our <i>E.
  Blandina</i>, several specimens were formerly taken by some entomologists
  in the Isle of Arran, where, as also in other mountain districts, it may
  probably still exist; but its haunts have to be re-discovered by some
  enterprising butterfly-hunter.</p>

  <p>From <i>Blandina</i>, which it almost exactly resembles on the upper
  surface, it may be distinguished by the marking of the under side of the
  hind wing, on which is an irregular, broken band of <i>pure white</i>,
  and between this and the margin a row of <i>three</i> distinct black
  eye-spots.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p><span class="sc">Argynnis Dia.</span>&mdash;WEAVER'S
  FRITILLARY.&mdash;This species is so nearly like <i>Euphrosyne</i> or
  <i>Selene</i>, on the upper surface, that it readily might be, and
  perhaps <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span>sometimes is, passed by as one of those
  common insects. Underneath it is chiefly recognised by the beautiful
  blush of <i>silvery purple</i> that extends in a band across the middle
  of the hind wings, and more faintly tinges the front wings near the
  tip.</p>

  <p>There is little reason to doubt that this insect was really taken by
  Mr. Richard Weaver at Sutton Park, near Tamworth; also by Mr. Stanley,
  near Alderley, in Cheshire.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p><span class="sc">Chrysophanus Chryseis.</span>&mdash;The PURPLE-EDGED
  COPPER Butterfly.&mdash;As this species has been admitted by that very
  careful and accurate entomologist, Mr. Stainton, into his "Manual," I
  cannot refuse it a place here, though, from all the information I can
  gain, its only claim to the name of "British" rests on a tradition of its
  having been taken a long time ago in Ashdown Forest, Sussex; and since
  then, by a <i>dealer</i>, in Epping Forest. It is a beautiful insect,
  coppery red, bordered with changeable purple, and I should be glad to see
  it fairly established in our lists.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p><span class="sc">Polyommatus Bæticus.</span>&mdash;The LONG-TAILED
  BLUE.&mdash;This Butterfly has been long known, as a <i>southern</i>
  insect, with a very wide range of distribution, abounding in the south of
  Europe and thence extending into India, Java, &amp;c. Then last year it
  was seen in <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>Guernsey, and in August of the same year
  an individual was actually captured in this country, the scene of the
  event being somewhere on the chalk downs in the neighbourhood of
  Brighton, and the fortunate captor being Mr. McArthur, of that town. My
  friend and neighbour, Dr. Allchin, of Bayswater, was on the spot at the
  time, and saw the insect shortly after its capture.</p>

  <p>The <i>butterfly</i>, which on the upper side has somewhat of the
  aspect of a female "Common Blue," will be at once recognised by its
  <i>long tail-like appendages to the hind wings</i>. Beneath, its plan of
  colouring is totally distinct from that of any of our native "Blues"
  (<i>Polyommati</i>), being destitute of the numerous little eye-like
  spots, which are replaced by bands of fawn colour and white; but at the
  lower angle of the hind wings are two spots of glittering metallic green,
  reminding one, on a small scale, of the "eye" of a peacock's feather.</p>

  <p>The habits of the insect are those of our Common Blues&mdash;skipping
  about over grassy places, and for a Common Blue it would on the wing be
  readily mistaken.</p>

  <p>Collectors will in the coming season doubtless search the south coast
  district thoroughly, and many a Common Blue will be apprehended on
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>Should our little friend <i>Bæticus</i> continue his northward
  progress (as we have some reason to hope he may), we may find him
  regularly enrolled on the native lists, and gracing the ranks of that
  select little company entitled "Our British Butterflies."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6" href="#NtA6">[6]</a> As beginners in entomology are, I
  know, often glad to be informed of some reliable dealer from whom to
  procure the apparatus required for the pursuit, I have pleasure in here
  giving the name of Mr. T. Cooke, of 30, Museum Street (six doors from the
  British Museum), where all the apparatus mentioned in this work, and
  numerous other natural history articles, are to be found, good and cheap,
  I believe. For the guidance of young amateurs, I will mention the prices
  of a few of the more necessary articles I have myself purchased or
  examined at the above establishment. Cane ring-nets, with stick, and
  ready for use, 2<i>s.</i>; ring-net, with three-jointed metal ring and
  screw-socket, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; pocket collecting-boxes, corked,
  3<i>d</i>. to 1<i>s.</i> each; store-boxes, 10 in. by 8 in., corked top
  and bottom, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; drying houses, for securely keeping
  setting-boards when in use, and containing eleven corked setting-boards
  and drawer for pins, &amp;c., 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; sheet cork for
  lining cabinets, 7 in. by 3½ in., 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> doz. sheets;
  entomological pins, three sizes, mixed, 1<i>s.</i> oz., &amp;c.,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7" href="#NtA7">[7]</a> Polyommatus B&oelig;ticus.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8" href="#NtA8">[8]</a> A very ingenious and neat
  contrivance&mdash;the invention of my friend Dr. Allchin, of Bayswater.
  It may be obtained of Messrs. Cooke &amp; Son, Naturalists, 30, Museum
  Street, London, W.C. It is of brass, with screw caps, the inner one
  having a small hole through which the chloroform can be used, drop by
  drop. The price is 4<i>s.</i> Also, the new Cyanide Killing-bottles,
  1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; 2<i>s.</i> ready for use.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt9" href="#NtA9">[9]</a> <i>Cleopatra</i>, as Duponchel
  observes, is found in France, only in the hottest parts, and is first
  seen as we go southwards, about Avignon, but abounds most on the shores
  of the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>Why the two varieties <i>Cleopatra</i> and the common <i>Rhamni</i>
  fly together we cannot fully explain; but it is possible there may be a
  constitutional difference between individual insects, just as we see that
  of two Englishmen going to a hot climate, one will brown deeply, while
  the complexion of the other will hardly alter, though exposed to the very
  same external influence.</p>
